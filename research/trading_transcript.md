all right ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the simcast it has been quite a while and it is fitting to have our first guest back on the show um as Jay Trader one of my favorite guys in the in the trading world just a great guy doing a lot for Traders out there um and actually has um I guess you could call it a world tour but it's a USA tour that's that's coming up soon and and trading Sim is happy to partner with Jay on that lot of exciting things going on in his family he's got a new baby coming along got a new Academy's building uh so Jay welcome back to the show man it's it's great to have you back thank you John it's always a pleasure to be over here with you with trading Sim and with all the the guys that traders that will listen to the to the podcast uh I prepare for today a little bit of exciting stuff and uh we uh the starting of 2024 uh the last couple of months I've been tracking a lot of uh patterns of traps where I would say the smart money or you can call it big hands they try to trap tra Traders and both long and short and we'll see some examples on small caps on big caps as well how they trap so I would say that these examples will be very useful for not only beginner Traders but also for advanced Traders because when you start knowing and learning how they can trap and manipulate the market you can take this to your advantage so if you want we can start and I will share my screen let's jump in there I'm looking forward to this so the smart money trap I wanted to call it like that because this is exactly what it's happening in the market right now and I believe the more we'll have the algorithms work working so all these has funds that are quants so they use algorithmic trading um and uh high frequency trading we will see more traps uh investors Traders better have to be very knowledgeable nowadays it's not anymore trading a breakout or a breakdown or buying a break of the vwap that you will make money sometimes will work but remember that there are there institutions that are simply studying the market and they're studying the psychology and the behavior of the investor so if they know that everybody's going to break out a level so they're waiting for the breakout and they know that investor they know that Traders will simply jump in What are they going to do if they have an agenda if they have the liquidity if they have the capability to do that they will do their trap so maybe they already have a pretty big portion and they will look for a simply fake breakout so they will look for a breakout they will Fake It Out means that they will start selling on this new created liquidity and over here we simply want to go now looking at some examples so that it will be pretty clear with you for you so the first thing that I want to cover here is the fake breakdown and uh how it happens bnz is a stock that uh we had at the end of the year 2023 the news was Bai executes Loy to acquire top rated lead generation platform we have a stock with a very tiny float so we're talking about uh a small market cap we have around 20 million we have also over here uh three million flow so we're talking about really a micr flat institutional is pretty high 35% being a small cap and we have SSR on so sure sale restriction few things to say about the small caps uh by tracking all the small caps since 2017 since I started trading small caps uh since 2017 gaps above 30% John with at least a 1 million volume Trader on the day and a market cap below 700 million well 71% faded on day one or at least we can say better it close they close below the open level this doesn't mean that they won't extend uh maybe 20 30 40% before fading but the point is that three out of four they tend to close right on the day so this means that if we are like buold Traders and we try to trade small caps on in the long term we're going to be losers if we don't have a strategy okay now is this on is that on first the first day that they run or the first day did they run 71% Clos right on the day gotcha then I wanted to look at the difference between 2023 with for example 2020 which was a bull year it was a year that was pretty strong we had a lot of small cap Traders uh we had also uh covid so uh tra uh people were at home they become like you know part-time Trader they wanted to study and we had a lot a lot of volume what changes is not really the percent of faders 2023 versus 2020 they're almost the same 2020 we have 73% faders on day one and 2023 we have 71 so almost there what changes is the amount of volume volume that was around 10 million average uh per stock more in 2020 versus 2023 so a little more liquidity back then everybody exactly putting their Co checks to work I give you just some numbers uh an amount of uh we say gappers above 30% in 2023 with at least 1 million volume we're still talking about more than 400 gappers so it's still a market that has some very good opportunities so let's get into the manipulation so if we do know manipulation was before 200 5 2006 more made by market makers so when I was trading Italian market and cover warrants I still remember that there were market makers from De Bank soel unic credit and all of the these big firms that actually had a person over there since 2006 2007 2008 we had more the I was say switch from the person to the algorithms and the more we're going into 2024 2025 and on I believe the more algorithm so the more like uh we say automatic system will work in the market and um over here we see one of these early runners in the morning so we can see that over here we start 8:30 the news pops out SSR is also one of those I would say red flags to short because SSR means short sale restrictions so you cannot Direct directly short on the bid and they have a float very very small 3 million so only three million of a here and you can rotate the float and we found that SSR high volume micro float with a news they tend really to run so for who's out there you will see if you start tracking this a lot of these runners in the morning or midday they have the same stats or very similar parameters okay so what I like over here Jay is that often we see the first push and then we start looking for a fail and on this fail of the vwap we will see early short seller jumping in but instead we always need to wait for a lower high in order to trade and we have to look for a pattern of fake breakout of stuff otherwise if we trade weakness so we start shorting weakness we're going to have generally big losses in this case what do we have over here we have a a pattern of U wedge and uh we start looking for this consolidation and we start having a breakout now this is a level where I would really like to buy the breakout and we'll see after how we execute it because you're buying a consolidation and you're not buying the high over here but instead you're you're still buying a relative low risk entry near the V up which is this red line and the things that I you have to monitor here are the volume are the sequence of higher lows and high highs and uh really the prints so I start looking at the tape generally it's a tape where I have a little bit of filters so at times in sales where at least I look for 5,000 or on very liquid liquid stocks maybe like $1 stocks I start looking for a filter of minimum 10,000 shares so that the more I see this block passing the more I know that buyers are in control so demand is in control and we can see that the start really moving up over here because we go from $180 $190 over here this is already 280 so it's $1 in about 20 30 minutes over here so we're talking about 30 40 50% of move in about 1 hour that's that's not a bad move over here actually from this low to this High we go more than 100% but what I would like that Traders and over here just start tracking okay start looking for how they trap so everybody is going to look or to buy breakouts and in in this case if you're a retailer don't buy breakouts that's what I want to tell you because you will lose money and you will end up writing to me or or John and saying hey I'm trading small caps every time I buy breakouts I get stuff and it's true you don't have to buy breakouts the best thing is to wait for a breakdown of a support like in this case you can see that you break the vwap and then if we start reclaiming the vwb and we have like a cup pattern generally between 9:45 and 11:00 we have this C and handled um pattern and that's the moment where you want to buy so this um this kind of like this this cup and handle right here you got exactly exactly the point for me is that once we see the shorts that are trapped below the vwap and then we reclaim that vwap and we start making a higher low I look for prints coming in again buyers in the control I start looking at the volume over here uh uh rising and then I can take a relative low risk entry and this is very key that we look for this between 9:45 and 11 o'clock and why is that important why is the the timing important there because they need the first 15 20 minutes to trap over here the retailers on a fake breakdown because over here it could even happen that this fails got it nobody tells that it's not going to fail but if we have this pattern well then be ready that it's going to be a trap fair enough yeah and so just just kind of like observationally here it looks like you've got a nice um you kind of undercut this this this low from the the market open where it comes down and then and then once it reclaims that area you know dips below it here like the Trap you were talking about exactly and then we got a nice it looks like this this little retest right here is on low volume almost like Supply kind of dried up on the on the retest of that level which is to me indicative of a lack of selling coming in and so that might be where you know my ears would kind of turn back up and say okay we we retested this breakdown um on low volume and then I would be like like you're saying expecting something to happen over here where this where you have this Arrow like do we do we reclaim this with a cup in handle and then does the volume pick back up and and those um those sellers did they start giving up their their shares for their short short selling shares um you know capitulating there exactly exactly but they don't the big hands over here they have an agenda so generally this agenda is to raise money through uh an offering so they have the illusion on and they could have you know an S1 or they could have an S3 or warrants or ATMs or the market offering and they need generally because they they have a lack of cash okay they need to raise money in order to continue with their like test maybe a new biotech company is making a new drug and they want to raise money and in order to raise money they need to dump shares and of course they won't dump shares down here if they can if they find a kind of manipulation like this where they can trap shorts and push them higher over here because over here I believe that some shorts will simply start adding they may look for this huge amount of liquidity created again breakout to start dumping and then over here what we have we have a new bull trap so over here we find a bear trap and over here we have a bol trap and that's the reason why again we say don't start buying Traders breakouts because often these breakouts won't work you have to buy dips like you buy this dip over here you start buying this dip over here and once you have inste set these levels if you're long start to trim Out start to sell partial and if then we have a pattern like this where we see a fake breakout this is a major stuff I like to call it J Slam because it's a particular formation of three four bars very narrow and then we have a push and then right away a big dump with a huge amount of volume of here so this case you can see the big selling pressure and that's the first I would say candle that tells us okay over here somebody dumped hard so sold a huge amount of shears we're talking on this bar this is a one minute chart we're talking about oh almost 1.3 1.4 million trade on that bar and then still don't start shorting over here wait to see what the market is doing are we doing higher lows and our highs or we're doing a push so we're staying below this resistance and we start forming lower highs lower lows this is a consolidation that once I start seeing this after a bull trap over here of the day then I'm looking for that unwind it's beautiful and I want to share with here Jay how we uh uh traded this so that shift of bias uh this example was share why we were trading the day you can see over here the time stamps so we long on that formation that we were seeing before and then we took some profit and over here we start taking the first short after the open on a fake breakout looking for dips uh the trade over here didn't work because you can see that it started to climb again and that's the reason why we got out entirely over here we tried then along didn't work out right away and once we start seeing that breakout so over here and this was around uh 1039 1040 over here we see 1039 439 setting up for a short and then we're looking to sell of it here at 340 why this again that fake breakout that bull trap now this is a skilled Trader so is not a beginner Trader so started to short over here over here more profits more profit and then all the way down and this is what the market is doing now if you think we were let's say uh simply retailers we would probably wait the gate and buy the breakout of here 9:30 MH and then once we see for example um this level we will stop out maybe go short and then get trapped again so it's very important to learn this type of manipulation it's a great example of what I would you know just call that that early early trading day um you know once the Bell opens just a nice bear trap and then almost you know know 30 minutes to an hour later um a bull trap just exactly exactly picture perfect that's the reason why small caps are very tough to trade I mean they're very remunerative Because unless you trade options there's no big cap that will go from $2 up to 3.6 in about two hours so the return in terms of percentage is really really crazy the point is you really have to be skilled and and have in your mind multiple scenarios already that you've seen over and over and over so tracking a lot of scenarios so that you don't get stuck simply long because over here you can take the best long of the world but if you don't know over here that this is going to be a reversal and you're probably GNA hold maybe you end up the day even red so right very important for this another example of how big hand trrap retailers on day two and um this I would say is a setup that is the same since 2017 so since I started tracking small caps um the first thing is again look on day one what happens we have a stock with 28 million float low cash and we have a dilution in this case it's the market offering this means that the company can dump in order to raise money uh whenever they want without uh have to price the offering it's not like a warrant they have to exercise their certain price uh price is not like a nestry they have to have a prospectus with the price of the offering they can dump any time and the same example we saw before this is omga I think like two weeks ago we have a morning fake breakdown you can see the support and once we have this fake breakdown they start reclaim the view up and they push it and again over here we have another Spike this often is a is a bull trap same exact example we saw before and then they start like being sideway all day now what I want you to focus on is in day two this is a setup that we're leaving over here John for who is gonna watch this a very good uh I would say strategy start looking what is the highest volume Trader level so the point of control of this day one and over here we see the this Red Line This is the point of control we have also a high volume node so hvn over here and then a low VN and a low VN so this area is the area where we have the major of the volume once we start in the morning and opens over here and it tries to push it's like if we have a major resistance just above so this level it's a major resistance so every single time that somebody over here tries to buy we will start seeing sellers jumping in it's simply a physiological setup that has been like this in the last six now seven years if the volume of here is weak I wait for a stuff I wait for uh seeing sellers I wait for a resistance I start looking at their flow in this case we can start like looking for a short but in order to avoid traps I always wait that we have a breakdown and then I'm looking for a first rejection of that level because I don't want to buy sorry I don't want to short the break down like over here I short a breakdown okay I'm in earn maybe 10 cents boom I get trapped I lose like uh enough of a here to have a very bad day I short the breakup no I wait and then I start waiting for pops if these levels over here if these pop pops cannot reclaim that previous support it's also a very important FIB level 61.8% then I'm not sure 100% because we're always trading everything is possible but we have like more than 70% by stats that this will close right on the day and this is exactly so what I'm looking for that plan high volume day of day one shorting below that after a breakdown waiting for a rejection and and ideally if I have a fib level or something else can add more conviction like an order flow to my plan I'm looking for that short that's uh that's really nice yeah and so just the the first day there was the high liquidity day right um you get the bear tra the bull trapped you they're trying to offload their shares and then what you're looking to play is that second morning of the failed continuation so if it doesn't continue up the second day you're looking to play that breakdown exactly nice and how is it that you you found your levels there was it just the Fibonacci level or was um was it just the that that key bear trap level from the day before where you want to play that exactly so I believe in a concept that is conf fluenced of signals to add odds if we have only one signal let's say we have 20% in our favor but if I start adding signals to my plan then I have more percentage of odds that I will be sueding in the setup one is the fact that we had the beer trap so that's a very important key area because I know that that level is has still like some kind of impact some memory over here then I have the Fib so we have a second signal and then also I have this support because over here we held we held we held so if now we break that level of demand and that demand becomes Supply that's my third signal plus we can look at the vwap we can look at overlow so I can get four to five signals to tell me that's going to be a good short again I always have to look at the volume because any time you know they can start holding maybe this level over here and start propping in this maybe Hal and close above $6 but until I see this lower high lower low low volume day two or day three are generally uh when we have this setup fitting this way and you like that level better than you like say the the the pre-market breakdown just above it you would You' you'd rather see this this key level from the prior day because you think that's more important correct it's a multi-day level so for me it has more validity oh cool and over here this is a execution from a Trader in the room exactly looking for that in this case we have a f minute chart so we're looking for a breakdown he looked over here for the pops uh putting a stop above and then looking for the for thewind nice one more example over here about vwb the think we spoke about vwap a lot of times um and I would say that smart money they know exactly how to trap around the vwap now generally Traders would look for a breakout of the vwap uh to Long breakdown of the V up to short but I want to show you how we had a shift in this uh like 10 days ago more or less uh on Tesla so talking about big caps on the vweb and how they like to trap in the morning so over here we had Tesla uh first of all Tesla was in downtrend so downtrend the last three days and this was the first of sorry this was the 3D of January 2024 uh premarket we have a very tight range so it's not really over here extending it's moving in 1.5 points so very narrow trading range what I like to do John in the morning is always trace my levels so daily resistance uh looking for a point of control of the week looking for also the premarket High premarket low and if I see that we have a trading range I generally look to trade out of that trading range not in the middle or I'm looking to trade extreme so for example I'm never going to buy over here this level so so this uh uh level up here as a breakout and I will look instead to short this level over here I will never look to shore this level over here I will buy more this level so I'm looking always at Bear traps and bull trap because that's how big hands like to to behave and like to trap retailers so the first thing is that we open over here 9:30 this has a instant flush so a wash out the into premarket support and then right away it start bouncing back up at this point we think okay this is a wash out so they faked over here breakdown Let's Take Along and that's a good idea but we will see how this instead doesn't work and how you have to react so fast if you trade in the first five minutes that's the reason why also I invite beginners not to trade the first few minutes maybe wait the first 10 to 15 minutes to see how the market is behaving if we are like trending or sideways range because if you're not fast skilled and well prepared generally the open is a very tough Beast to manage we had a push over here into the key level and if you're long over here now you're waiting for this higher lows and higher highs or at least a breakout consolidation and push doesn't happen and over here we see on Bounce from support big hands try to hold hold and show a long opportunity the fact over here is that instead of seeing that breakout we see right away the price going from green to red again so long over here we have to change our bi to now to short and all of this is a major rounded cup so we can see this the rounded cup now the here is where where the reversal confirms because it can even happen that we go down here and bounce up again but once over here breaks down and we start having this consolidation just like we saw before on that day two so you waiting for the breakdown you wait for a consolidation and then this is a clear confirmation that we're not anymore stuck in our range on a breakdown you take the first pullback and now you're looking to short few things to say over here volume when you have this breakdown and all these candles are with increasing volume means increasing selling pressure it's not like the example that for example you said before uh it's unwinding but the volume is decreasing showing that there are no sellers over here we have really a lot of sellers because each time that they start like dumping the volume is increasing the volume is increasing and this means that once we broke the support everybody over here is on the really is on in their way to start selling pops this is something that I saw on Tesla on Nvidia on the q's on spy so a very I would say actual pattern and uh this is for example what uh is how you should be trading it w that's long and over here if you're not skilled enough you will simply stay in and maybe stop down here instead of here there's a reversal so shift long to to short and then you can start simply trading all the way down I would say the best is wait for the breakdown and then start selling after the first consolidation over here the trader uh is very skilled I like the play uh this is more advanced but you want to stay like comfortable wait the trend line break in this case a range breakdown and start shorting pops if you have no reclaim over here of vwap and in this case on the one minute we're staying below a 9 MAA you can see this line over here I mean this is fantastic yeah that is a beautiful downtrend so I'm just looking there it looks like you know you've got a nice little confirmation of um you know just kind of a mini a mini bull trap there yeah then and that's what you're talking about just kind of uh reverses your your bias to the downside is that right exactly but it's very tough because you know first they tell you okay we're going down at the gate so let's short it and then boom they bounce it back up so you're long in it and then you have to change bias a third time and that's the reason why you know if Traders don't know this kind of manipulation they get stuck the trade maybe goes down they were shorted open then they get stopped they they got frustrated and the thought instead goes down maybe 10 points and they said oh I was short I just have held it yeah well talk maybe if you don't mind just a minute or two about like the psychology of that like you know because I know a lot of new Traders it's difficult for them to shift their mindset yeah especi especially that quickly yeah exactly so the first thing I would say is in order to improve the price section recognition there are three tools that I love the first thing is for me every single day no matter if you trade it or not and I'm talking serious Traders uh I would invite everybody to annotate your chart for example you take a chart and you start putting what was the setup where you had to enter where you have to stop out how you have to trail of course you will tell me J it's a that's a stupid thing because 2020 everybody knows how to do it but the more you do this the more you imprint your mind how is the correct setup is like you have to go to a soccer game and I used to play soccer when I was very very small so uh ccho and uh the coaches would always give us the plan the tactic and then you have to trade it you have to uh play and put that tactic in action what else you need when the coach gives you that tactic you need to train a lot and for me training is ret trading so I had a lot of mentoring mentoring Traders during 2023 and I made really two different groups one was ret trading almost every day and we used trading Sim and other group was not ret trading at all I mean the group that started ret trading did so much more improvements in a shorter time why because if I look now Jay this stock over here in Tesla there will be other days during the year that maybe Tesla Nvidia spy qes will do the same exact setup if I trade it one time what kind of confidence I have it yes I can study maybe two hours this today in six months I won't remember but if I start like every single time that I have this setup track it and retrade it even five six times in a day in two weeks we have the same setup ret traded other two weeks we have the same setup ret traded you start really making become this thing part of your memory it's something like you do every day I have a coffee every morning I have to I would say uh do my work at every morning I go in automatic mode the same thing has to be trading if you see this and you know that you can shift bias from long to short to long again or to short again and that it's happening so recognize these traps if you ret traded you gain that muscle memory in this case of the brain memory that will help you when you're trading life and the third part is also record what you're doing so record your screen and look and talk when you watching your recording and be critic to yourself why did I trade over here a lot of times I when I do errors I I listen to myself and I talk to myself looking at what I Trad in and I say what I was doing I was really like a dummy like there was nothing over here to short and maybe I short it you know like and then 2020 yeah I knew it that was not as short but you have to do this kind of job these are three fundamental tools that will help you in trading annotation ret trading and then also rewat in your recorded session you have something more to add over here Jay no I think I think you hit the nail on the head I think that especially you know reach rating just review that whole process is um is really powerful um I think for me you know because I I can still get stuck in that that mindset of well I want this to go a certain way you know so if I'm taking the long position you know it takes time and and honestly maybe it just takes um the experience of of losing and getting stopped out to so many times that you're like you know what maybe I should not marry my idea yeah and I should have the foresight to to see different scenarios play out okay so if I take this long if this happens then I'm good but if this happens then that should completely change my mindset so I want to have like a couple of different scenarios over here that if if it plays out that way then I need to adjust my thinking instead of marrying the the position that I wanted to take and and trying to force that you know like a like a square peg into a round hole you know it's just not happening so you know staying like you're saying like staying uh staying flexible in the moment and taking the information and then adjusting whatever it is that you've made so if it's if you're long but then you get that that nice little um that nice little bull trap you got to take that information otherwise like you know like you're saying you're just being a dummy you covered that and I know because I've been a dummy so many times everybody but is it and even if you know you become consistent and profitable you still do uh there still will be days where you can call me a dummy because everybody does mistakes any moment of Life the only thing is that when you are more I would say advaned we have more experience you can simply recognize faster that you do in an error now your your wife's not over there shaking her head is she she has over here the headset so she's listening it's better so we can go to uh the last one I would say that this is also um a good example so if you have more ministrators over here this is what I wanted to share with you and doesn't really happen only in small caps it happens also in big caps I've seen this on Baba lately I've seen this on uh futu uh two three days after the earnings so SX in this case is a small caps but again this pattern you can find on many different assets uh the fact over here is that we have a stock again with SSR we have a stock with 10 million float and you can read the news down here it says simply solid in x announces publication demonstrating complete protection against disease in nonhuman private mods and of Ebola Marvel versus so I don't even know what I read but the point is that they will try to make it song complicated for you and every single time they try to get the news to I would say invite you to buy just like explain if this is the best you know like uh news Innovation or discover ever made two things to see bear trap again and Bol trap again so we're not simply showing today's examples where you know they're pretty easy you know buy this short that I'm just over here with John today to explain you what the market is doing and the setup that you can look and recognize yourself you start tracking doesn't mean that from tomorrow you go trade this no you have to track it just study the market and over here I just want to go over again premarket support and key dollar level one Buck there are many psychological reasons why Traders would like to short a $1 $2 $3 $250 on Tesla for example uh 400 on Nvidia and so on because those are psychological numbers everybody likes to fill of one buck five bucks 400 bucks but if you think that big hands know this and they will know that or you stop out let's say you're long and you're going to stop out or that you're going to short because you know that that's a key level and you think is going to break down from there what they're going to do they're going to do the opposite of what you think because they know you so being that there's artificial intelligence right now Behind These algorithms don't you think that they will like observe how the retailer is thinking and use that to their advantage to make money for their firms exactly so if you see something like this start thinking again do we have buyers or sellers in control look at the volume of it here increasing already in these true candles and you can see that we have a freight breakdown and right away you close above that's very very strong it's a powerful entry setup again over here what happens we have a bull trap but only 2020 we know that this is a bull trap because maybe this could have dipped over here and pushed back up so if you remember before we said one thing never short the front side always wait for a peak in this case has to be a kind of trap so you see that fake out you see that longs over here are trapped above a key technical resistance and once you see the breakdown wait for the lower high the same uh setup that we had on bzi the first I think chart that we shared we had over here over there it was above the pre-market High over here is below the pre-market high but it's a breakout of an intraday level and once we form this which is also you can see a bearish engulfing then you wait for that lower high if this lower high over here has no volume and you can see once we break the vwap over here look that selling pressure that is increasing that means we have sellers now ready all these Longs that bought over here above 112 they will stop out when on this breakdown right here and this is powerful again not only in small caps but on big caps as well midcaps it happens very very often you think you found a beer trap okay or the bull trap now I'm going to run instead you have a double bull trap or beer trap and it's going to reverse again and that why Market 2024 is highly uh remunerative but is also highly competitive and the reason that you have to educate yourself you have to study you have to improve so there are like really techniques behind that you have to learn that's awesome Jay yeah and and I you know what I love about these plays is that as a new Trader you often want to you think you have to time the top you know um but you don't have to do that I mean as you've shown right
