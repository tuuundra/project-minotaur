Excellent, thank you for the clarification.

I will compile a formal report organized by feature category—Log Returns, Volume Measures, Technical Indicators, Order Flow & Intra-Bar Microstructure, and Time-Based Features. For each of the selected features, I’ll provide insights into distribution shapes, expected ranges, outlier interpretations, predictive potential for BTC/USDT, and nuances under varying market regimes.

I will prioritize academic and crypto-specific empirical research, referencing broader quantitative finance literature only where necessary and with appropriate caveats. I’ll let you know as soon as the report is ready.


# Analysis of Engineered Trading Features for BTC/USDT (Dollar Bar Data)

## Log Returns (s\_log\_return\_close, m\_log\_return\_close, l\_log\_return\_close)

&#x20;*Figure: Distribution of monthly returns for Bitcoin vs S\&P 500, illustrating Bitcoin’s heavy-tailed return profile and more frequent extreme outcomes.*

* **Distribution Shape & Moments:** Bitcoin log returns at all horizons exhibit **non-normal, heavy-tailed distributions**. Daily and intraday returns typically show **excess kurtosis (fat tails)** and noticeable skewness. For example, one study found **daily BTC returns have high variability, significant negative skew, and excess kurtosis**, rejecting normality. Even when aggregating to weekly or monthly intervals, the returns **do not become normal and retain asymmetry and fat tails**. Longer-horizon returns (like l\_log\_return\_close) may show a slight **positive skew over multi-year bull cycles** (more large upside moves), whereas shorter horizons can reflect recent crash events as negative skew. Overall, **leptokurtic (fat-tailed)** distributions are consistent across short (s\_), medium (m\_), and long (l\_) returns, indicating frequent small moves and occasional extreme jumps.

* **Expected Volatility (Std Dev):** **Volatility is high across all time resolutions** of BTC/USDT. Short-term dollar bars (s\_log\_return\_close) have smaller individual moves but still high variability in aggregate. Annualized daily volatility often exceeded 50–100% (std dev), far above traditional assets. Notably, **realized volatility below 50% (annualized) has occurred only \~5% of the time in BTC’s history**, highlighting that high volatility is the norm. Medium and long horizon returns compound this volatility – e.g. monthly returns have ranged from over +100% to –50%, dwarfing stock market moves. **Volatility clustering** is present: periods of high volatility (large returns in either direction) tend to persist, whereas calm periods see consistently low volatility. Traders can therefore expect **shifting volatility regimes**, with quiet phases punctuated by bursts of extreme variance.

* **Outlier Behavior:** **Outliers are common** in BTC log returns, reflecting abrupt market moves. Fat-tailed distributions mean that **large returns (positive or negative) occur more often than a normal distribution would predict**. These outliers often correspond to news events, liquidations, or regime shifts. Notably, in bull runs, extreme daily gains of 10–20% or more have occurred, while in panics, crashes exceeding –30% in days or even hours have been seen. Outliers can be **asymmetric** across regimes: in manic bull phases, there are disproportionate large upward moves (contributing to positive skew on longer horizons), whereas in bear markets the most extreme single-day moves are often sharp drops. **Skewness can flip** depending on regime – studies found Bitcoin’s return distribution skew turned more positive during a deep bear (due to occasional big relief rallies), whereas during bull periods the distribution had more downside skew from sudden corrections. In all regimes, **tail risk is significant**, underscoring the need for risk management.

* **Predictive Relationships:** Past returns alone have limited predictive power in efficient markets, but Bitcoin returns exhibit some **momentum and mean-reversion phenomena** at different scales. Short-term (s\_) log returns may show **intraday momentum** – e.g. positive returns in one dollar bar can slightly increase odds of the next bar also being up, especially during strong trends (intraday momentum effect has been documented in crypto markets). However, at longer horizons, extreme returns often lead to **volatility continuation rather than simple reversal** – a huge move indicates a regime of elevated volatility that may persist (volatility clustering). That said, **mean reversion** can occur after extreme RSI or overbought/oversold conditions (see RSI below). Academically, **order flow and skewness** have more predictive content than raw returns: for instance, conditional skewness (a measure derived from return distribution) has been shown to predict future returns – during crises, higher (more positive) skewness precedes higher future Bitcoin returns, possibly because a positively skewed return distribution in a crash reflects an oversold market primed for a rebound. In practice, many traders use log return features in momentum or reversal strategies, but **performance varies by regime**. In raging bull markets, **“buy the dip” reversal trades were rewarded** as uptrends resumed quickly, whereas in steady bear markets momentum or trend-following on negative returns could be more effective. In sum, **log return features must be interpreted in context of volatility and regime** – a modest negative return in a bull market might be a buying opportunity, while the same in a bearish trend could signal further downside.

* **Behavior Across Regimes:** The statistical character of returns shifts between **bull, bear, and sideways markets**. In **bull markets**, returns have a **positive mean drift** and often a mild **negative skew** – steady small gains punctuated by abrupt drops (e.g. profit-taking pullbacks). Volatility can increase as the bull matures (due to speculative blow-off rallies). In **bear markets**, returns show **negative drift** but can exhibit **positive skew** – many small down days but occasional sharp relief rallies cause right-tailed outliers. Bear markets initially feature high volatility (during the crash and capitulation phase), then often transition to low-volatility grinding declines. **Sideways (consolidating) markets** typically have **lower volatility** and more symmetric, small returns (distribution concentrated around 0 with fewer extremes). Trend-following features (momentum) underperform in sideways periods, while mean-reversion of log returns is more common. Notably, extreme events (black swans) can happen in any regime but are more *anticipated* in transitions – **regime shifts (bull->bear or vice versa) coincide with clusters of outlier returns** as the market reprices rapidly. Analysts should therefore adjust expectations for feature behavior by regime: e.g. a 1% daily log return might be routine in a bull, but in a low-vol sideways phase the same 1% is relatively large and informative of a possible breakout.

## Volume Measures (volume, dollar\_volume)

* **BTC Volume per Dollar Bar (Distribution & Variability):** In dollar bars, each bar represents a fixed **notional traded (≈\$2 million)**, so the **BTC quantity (volume) varies inversely with price**. This volume (in BTC) has a **right-skewed distribution**: typically a few tens of BTC per bar in recent years, but **much higher BTC counts in earlier periods or during price dips**. For instance, when BTC price was only a few thousand USD, each \$2M bar contained hundreds of BTC; as price rose into tens of thousands, a bar might only hold a few dozen BTC. The distribution of `volume` is thus broad, spanning an order of magnitude or more across the dataset. **Extreme BTC volume values** (very high BTC in one bar) often occur when price briefly drops (making BTC cheaper) or during periods of extraordinary trading activity. These extremes can indicate **market stress or opportunity**: e.g. a sudden 10x jump in BTC volume within a bar may signal capitulation selling or a whale buy-up during a crash. Such bars are notable because they imply **very rapid turnover** of a large number of coins to reach the dollar quota. Overall, BTC volume per bar tends to be **low and stable in quiet markets**, and **spikes during volatile regimes** – consistent with the volume–volatility relationship where trading activity surges as prices swing. Heavy-tailed volume distribution means analysts should expect occasional huge spikes (rather than a neat normal range).

* **Significance of Extreme Volume Bars:** **Unusually large volume bars** (far out on the right tail of the distribution) are often associated with **breakouts or breakdowns**. In crypto markets, high volume confirms strong conviction – for example, a price breakout accompanied by a several-fold increase in volume suggests genuine buying interest fueling the move. Conversely, **volume climaxes** (e.g., highest BTC volume in months) can mark **turning points**: a capitulation bottom often sees a final surge of sell volume exhausting the supply, or a blow-off top sees euphoric buy volume before a reversal. Extreme volume also hints at **whale activity** or big institutions trading. Practically, traders monitor volume for validation of price moves (“volume confirms price”). On dollar bars, because time is an outcome, an extreme volume bar likely closed faster than usual (many trades in short time). This implies a **high-intensity event**, often news-driven. **Implications:** Sustained high volume typically aligns with **high volatility regimes** and can **signal regime shifts**. For instance, toward the end of a bull market, trading volume can remain extremely high even as price stalls – an indication of distribution (strong hands selling to latecomers). In contrast, in a dormant sideways market, consistently low volume indicates apathy. Thus, volume features are crucial for regime identification: **rising volume precedes large price moves**, and persistently extreme volume often flags that the current trend may be overextended.

* **Dollar Volume:** By construction, `dollar_volume` in these bars hovers around the target (e.g. \$2,000,000). There is **minimal variation** in dollar\_volume – each bar slightly overshoots the threshold (as the last trade pushes it over). The distribution of dollar\_volume is therefore tightly clustered around the set value (with minor noise). This feature mainly serves to confirm uniform liquidity sampling. It’s not very **informative as a predictor** since it’s almost constant by design. However, deviations might occur if the bar construction allowed a wider buffer – e.g. an exceptionally large last trade could cause a bar with \$2.5M instead of \$2M. Such cases are rare; if present, they might indicate a **market order sweep** that crossed the threshold significantly. In summary, **volume (BTC)** is the key variable with rich information, whereas **dollar\_volume is nearly fixed** (useful mostly for verifying the bar normalization).

* **Volume-Volatility Relationship:** It’s worth noting that **trading volume and price volatility are positively correlated in Bitcoin**. High-volume bars tend to coincide with large price range bars. This aligns with the **Mixture of Distributions Hypothesis**, where volume is a proxy for the flow of information: more active trading produces greater price variance. Empirical studies confirm that **unexpected spikes in volume explain a substantial portion of Bitcoin’s volatility**. Thus, volume features can enhance predictive models for volatility and returns. That said, the volume-return correlation can vary by regime – in extreme bull or bear phases, price can move on relatively lower incremental volume due to FOMO or panic, whereas in equilibrium markets, volume surges are more clearly tied to directional moves. Some research even suggests volume’s predictive power for returns diminishes during strong bull/bear regimes (when price is driven by sentiment/momentum rather than new information). Nonetheless, monitoring volume alongside returns is critical: **volume droughts** can precede consolidation or breakout failure, and **volume surges** often precede or confirm trend acceleration.

## Technical Indicators (s\_rsi\_14, m\_atr\_14, l\_adx\_14)

* **Short-Term RSI (14-period)** – *Relative Strength Index*: This oscillator (bounded 0–100) measures recent upside vs downside momentum. **Expected Range and Distribution:** In BTC/USDT, RSI\_14 typically fluctuates between \~20 and 80, with a mean around 50 (neutral). The distribution is **bimodal around uptrend and downtrend biases** – during strong uptrends RSI spends a disproportionate time in higher ranges (60+), whereas in downtrends it often stays low (40 or below). Crypto markets, known for persistent trends, can see RSI **pinned at extreme values** for extended periods. For example, in a raging bull market, daily RSI can remain above 70 (classically “overbought”) for weeks, and yet price continues to climb – a sign of sustained momentum rather than an immediate reversal signal. Conversely, in panics, RSI may linger in the “oversold” sub-30 zone for a long stretch. **Interpretability in Crypto:** Traditional RSI thresholds (30 oversold, 70 overbought) thus require caution. In volatile crypto markets, **oversold can become “more oversold”** and overbought can persist. Empirical analyses have found that naive RSI strategies yield mixed results; one study showed that the standard RSI(14) 70/30 strategy did **not consistently yield profits in crypto and even led to small losses on average**. This is partly because **crypto RSI signals have a higher false-positive rate in trends** – an RSI > 70 might *not* mark a top if a powerful uptrend is underway (the indicator can saturate near 80–90 during parabolic moves). Similarly, an oversold reading in a free-fall may not catch the bottom. That said, RSI remains useful to gauge **momentum and possible reversal risk**: extreme RSI values (90+ or below 10) are rare and often indicate an overextended market. In sideways or cyclic markets, RSI oscillations are more reliable for mean-reversion trades (bouncing between \~30 and \~70). **Volatility Implications:** Crypto’s higher volatility makes RSI swing more rapidly; short-term RSI (s\_rsi\_14 on dollar bars) will be quite choppy, reflecting quick shifts in momentum as each bar closes. Traders sometimes adjust RSI period or thresholds for crypto (e.g. using 80/20 instead of 70/30) to account for its tendency to trend hard. Overall, **RSI in crypto must be interpreted in context** – extreme readings warn of a possible reversal *coming*, but the timing is tricky. Using additional confirmation (e.g. trend direction or volume) is advised since **in trending regimes, RSI alone can stay extreme and “wrong” for a while**.

* **Medium-Term ATR (14-period)** – *Average True Range*: ATR measures the average range (high–low movement, accounting for gaps) over the past 14 bars, effectively a rolling volatility indicator. **Expected Ranges:** Because dollar bars are of varying length in time, ATR on a medium resolution (m\_atr\_14) captures the typical price movement per bar over a mid-term window. In BTC/USDT, ATR values will scale with price level – e.g., in a \$50k price environment, an ATR(14) might be hundreds of dollars if volatility is low, or several thousands of dollars if volatility is high. To interpret ATR meaningfully, it’s often shown as a percentage of price: crypto ATR can range from **tiny (e.g. <0.5% of price during very quiet periods)** to **huge (5–10%+ of price during turmoil)**. The distribution of ATR is **right-skewed** – mostly moderate values with occasional surges during high volatility episodes. **Volatility Implications:** ATR essentially mirrors realized volatility. In calm, sideways markets or early-stage trends, ATR(14) will decline, reflecting smaller consistent bar ranges. During breakouts, news shocks, or liquidations, ATR spikes dramatically. Bitcoin’s volatility is known to **cluster in regimes**: for instance, in late 2022–2023, BTC volatility hit historically low levels (ATR shrinking correspondingly), whereas in March 2020 or May 2021, volatility spiked to extreme highs. **Effectiveness Across Market States:** ATR is very effective at indicating **shifts in volatility regime**. A rising ATR signals expanding range – often a breakout or breakdown in progress – whereas a falling ATR signifies consolidation. In bull markets, ATR tends to rise in the most explosive rally phases (when daily swings grow in magnitude) and can stay elevated if the uptrend has large pullbacks. In prolonged bear markets, after the initial crash, ATR may gradually decline as the market stabilizes at lower activity, but any sudden panic sell-off will cause a volatility jump. A medium-term ATR like m\_atr\_14 will smooth out very short-term noise yet respond to regime changes within a few bars. Traders use ATR for position sizing (e.g. wider stop-losses in high ATR periods). For BTC/USDT, one might observe ATR14 in 2023 at multi-year lows as price flattened – a sign of a **sideways regime with low risk** – whereas during 2021’s bull run ATR14 expanded greatly. **Distribution-wise**, ATR is non-negative and usually bounded on the lower end by a floor (crypto rarely stays too quiet for long) while the upper tail is theoretically unbounded (big news could double the price, etc.). In practice, ATR spikes are constrained by circuit-breaker-like market mechanics (e.g. mass liquidation events have a peak magnitude). Summarily, **m\_atr\_14 is a valuable gauge of market volatility** in the medium term, and its behavior clearly demarcates bull (rising or high ATR), bear (initial high then falling ATR, with spikes on crashes), and quiet markets (low, stable ATR).

* **Long-Term ADX (14-period)** – *Average Directional Index*: ADX is a trend strength indicator. It ranges from 0 to 100 and **measures the strength of a trend (up or down) over 14-bar periods** on the long resolution. **Expected Distribution:** ADX values in BTC/USDT tend to be **low the majority of the time and occasionally very high** during strong trends. Often, ADX hovers below 20 in choppy, directionless conditions. When a genuine trend emerges (sustained up or down movement), ADX rises above 25, which is the classic threshold indicating a **strong trend**. In the context of crypto, ADX can reach extreme readings: values in the 40–60 range indicate a very powerful trend. For example, during the 2017 and 2021 bull runs, a long-term ADX(14) calculated on daily or weekly bars likely climbed well above 50, reflecting the persistent uptrend. Similarly, in a steep bear decline (e.g., late 2018 or 2022), ADX would also be high, as the downtrend was strong. **Interpretability in Crypto Markets:** ADX does not tell direction (only strength), so it must be paired with price direction or DMI components (+DI/–DI). In crypto, which often alternates between explosive trends and range-bound pauses, ADX is useful to **distinguish regime**. **Low ADX (\~<20)** is very common in sideways markets – traders see this as an indication the market is trendless (and perhaps range-trading strategies may work). **Rising ADX** from low levels (crossing 20→25) is often a signal that a significant breakout is happening and a trend is forming. In BTC/USDT, such a rise could correspond to the start of a bull rally or the onset of a new bear slide. **High ADX readings (>50)** suggest a trend at peak strength, but also warn that the move may be overextended. Crypto being volatile, ADX can sometimes spike and then quickly drop if the trend abruptly ends (false breakouts can cause ADX to rise briefly). **Effectiveness Across Market States:** ADX shines in identifying *trending vs non-trending* states. In a **bull market**, ADX will generally climb during the advance and may show a series of peaks. Interestingly, ADX can decline even while price continues rising if the trend momentum eases – e.g., late in a bull run, price may keep making new highs but at a slowing pace, causing ADX to form lower peaks (a divergence indicating waning trend strength). In **bear markets**, ADX often accelerates on the initial crash (very strong downtrend), then might dip during interim relief rallies, and surge again on next leg down. During the quiet bottom/base-building phase of a bear, ADX falls below 20 as price enters a range. **ADX Distribution Considerations:** Because ADX is bounded and generally spends a lot of time at low values in consolidation, its distribution is skewed toward the lower end with a long tail for strong-trend periods. The **mode might be around 10-20** (reflecting many bars of no trend), and only a minority of time does ADX exceed 40. This skew means that when modeling, many bars contribute little trend info (low ADX), and a few bars carry a lot of information (high ADX indicating an established trend). **Crypto-specific behavior:** Crypto’s propensity for sudden regime shifts means ADX can ramp up faster than in traditional markets – a single week’s large breakout can send ADX from 15 to 30 quickly. It also can drop fast if a trend breaks (due to the lagging nature, it will eventually fall if trend stops). On balance, ADX(14) at a long resolution is a **reliable tool** to confirm when BTC/USDT is in trending mode (bull or bear) versus when it’s meandering. Traders often use rules like *ADX > 25 = trend trading favored; ADX < 20 = avoid trend strategies*, which generally hold true for crypto as well.

## Order Flow & Intra-Bar Microstructure (trade\_imbalance, intra\_bar\_tick\_price\_volatility)

* **Trade Imbalance:** This feature quantifies the excess of buyer-initiated volume over seller-initiated volume (or vice versa) in each bar – often measured as `(buys – sells) / (buys + sells)`. **Distribution:** Trade imbalance for BTC/USDT dollar bars will be centered near 0 in most cases (markets often have near-balanced buyer vs seller volume) but with a reasonably large standard deviation and **frequent excursions to imbalance extremes**. The range is typically **-1 to +1**, where +1 would mean all volume in that bar was buyer-initiated (aggressive buying) and -1 means all selling. In practice, values might rarely hit absolute 1.0 since some mix of buyers and sellers is usually present, but it’s not uncommon to see bars with imbalance of +0.8 (80% buy volume) or -0.8 (80% sell volume) during strong moves. The distribution of `trade_imbalance` is likely **double-peaked toward the extremes**: during quiet trading, imbalance hovers near 0 (buy and sell volume roughly equal), but during impulsive moves, imbalance skews heavily to one side. Thus there may be a higher density of observations at moderate imbalances plus fat tails approaching ±1 when one side dominates. **Interpretation of Magnitudes:** **High positive imbalance** (e.g. >+0.5) indicates *dominant buying pressure* – many more market buys than sells in that bar – often seen in bullish breakouts or sustained uptrends. **High negative imbalance** (<–0.5) indicates *heavy selling pressure* – more aggressive selling, common in panicky selloffs. Magnitudes near zero suggest a balanced order flow, typically in range or indecisive markets. **Strong sentiment or conditions:** An imbalance above +0.7 or below -0.7 in a single bar is significant – it signals **urgent one-sided trading**. For instance, if trade\_imbalance = +0.8 in a bar, there was intense buying (perhaps news-driven or a short squeeze) overwhelming sellers, usually accompanied by an uptick in price. On the contrary, -0.8 could mean capitulative selling, likely driving price down that bar. **Predictability:** Order flow imbalance is a **high-frequency predictor of short-term price movements**. Research shows that net order flow has predictive power for returns – essentially, if substantially more buys than sells occur, the price tends to rise and vice versa. In fact, a recent study found order flow imbalances have a **permanent price impact and strong out-of-sample predictive power on crypto returns**. In practice, this means consistently positive imbalance bars often precede or coincide with upward price drift (momentum), whereas negative imbalance often precedes downward moves. Traders sometimes use cumulative trade imbalance as a sentiment indicator. **Caveats (Misinterpretations):** It’s important not to interpret imbalance in isolation. A *common misinterpretation* is assuming **extreme buy-imbalance means a guaranteed imminent price rise** – while it shows strong demand in that bar, it could also indicate a short-term *exhaustion* if, for example, an aggressive buyer temporarily moved the price up and now no buyers remain at higher levels. Similarly, extreme sell-imbalance could mark capitulation (after which price may actually bounce). So context matters: one bar’s imbalance can be misleading if liquidity dynamics change right after. Generally though, sustained imbalance (multiple bars in one direction) is a clearer signal of trend. Another nuance is that a large imbalance might not move price much if liquidity was deep (absorbed by passive orders), whereas a smaller imbalance in a thin order book could move price a lot. **Distribution in regimes:** In **bull markets**, we might observe a slight bias toward positive imbalance on average (as aggressive buying is more common), whereas in bears a bias to negative. But both regimes will still produce two-tailed distributions since even in bulls there are sell-dominated capitulation days and in bears there are short-covering buy bursts. **Summary:** Trade imbalance is a direct reflection of **order flow sentiment**; its extreme values highlight bars of unidirectional pressure and are strongly correlated with short-term price changes, but one must be cautious of trap scenarios (e.g., a spike of buying that is actually a blow-off).

* **Intra-Bar Tick Price Volatility:** This feature measures the volatility *within* each dollar bar, using high-frequency tick data. It could be defined as the standard deviation of tick-by-tick price changes or some intra-bar high-low variation normalized by number of ticks. **Distribution Characteristics:** Intra-bar volatility is **non-negative** and typically quite low for most bars, with a heavy right tail for turbulent bars. Most of the time, within a single bar (especially since dollar bars may span only a few minutes during active periods or hours during slow periods), tick-to-tick price changes are small, yielding a low intra-bar volatility value. However, when the market moves rapidly *during* the course of one bar (for example, a \$500 price swing up and down within the same \$2M volume chunk), this metric will spike. The distribution is thus **skewed right** – a majority of bars have low volatility, while a minority have extremely high volatility values. **Interpreting Magnitudes:** A “normal” intra-bar tick volatility for BTC might be on the order of, say, 0.0005 (if expressed as fraction of price) in calm conditions, whereas in a frenetic bar it could be 0.005 or higher – an order of magnitude larger. **High values** indicate that *within that bar, price was whipsawing or fluctuating significantly*. This could reflect fast back-and-forth trading or a partial reversal within the bar. **Strong sentiment or conditions:** Very high intra-bar volatility often coincides with **high uncertainty or news**. For instance, during a major announcement, you might see price jump up and down rapidly (high volatility) even if the bar ultimately closes only mildly changed. In contrast, trending bars with steady one-directional movement might actually have lower intra-bar volatility relative to their net change (since price moved mostly in one direction smoothly). So, intra-bar volatility is highest in **erratic conditions** – e.g., when algorithmic traders battle or when the order book thins out, causing **jagged price action**. It captures **market microstructure noise and turbulence**. **Predictability:** Intra-bar volatility tends to be a part of volatility clustering too – if one bar has high tick volatility, the next few bars often continue to be volatile. It can signal a regime change; e.g., a sudden uptick in intra-bar volatility after a period of quiet trading might presage a larger breakout as the market “wakes up.” However, by itself it doesn’t indicate direction – just that risk is elevated. Traders might interpret a combination of high trade imbalance and high intra-bar volatility as a sign of **potential trend exhaustion or reversal** – e.g., if price is surging but volatility is extremely high, it could mean the move is unstable. Conversely, moderate volatility with high imbalance might indicate a more orderly trend. **Common Misinterpretations:** One pitfall is to equate high intra-bar volatility with a trend – in reality it might just be noise or indecision (for example, during a consolidation with rapid up/down ticks but no net progress). Another is to ignore it: microstructure volatility can presage larger timeframe volatility. For instance, a market that suddenly gets very choppy (high intra-bar vol) after a long calm could be in the early stage of a regime shift. Some may misread low intra-bar volatility as a sign nothing is happening, missing that it could be the *calm before a storm*. In summary, intra-bar tick price volatility provides a lens on **market microstructure stability**: **low values** mean price changes were smooth or minimal within the bar, **high values** mean chaotic trading within the bar. This feature’s behavior across regimes: in **bull or bear trends**, intra-bar volatility can actually be moderate if the trend is orderly, but spikes during turning points or climactic moments; in **sideways markets**, it’s usually low except during false breakout attempts which register as volatile intrabar swings.

## Time-Based Features (s\_time\_hour\_of\_day, s\_time\_day\_of\_week)

* **Hour of Day Patterns:** Bitcoin trades 24/7 globally, but activity is not uniform through the day. The feature `s_time_hour_of_day` captures which hour a bar opened (or closed). **Known Intra-day Patterns:** Studies have found that BTC/USDT exhibits **diurnal cycles in volume and volatility**. Generally, trading activity (and volatility) tends to be **higher during the daytime of major financial centers** and lower during their night hours. For example, volume often picks up during U.S. market hours and again during the European morning. One research observed that **returns are lowest in the early morning UTC and highest in the afternoon/evening UTC**, likely corresponding to when both European and U.S. markets are active. Additionally, an analysis by Amberdata noted that the **U.S. and EU regions see higher BTC volatility during their stock trading hours**, whereas **Asian markets showed higher BTC volatility outside their local market hours**. This reflects how global participation affects Bitcoin: when New York or London are active, institutional and algorithmic trading flows increase liquidity and often volatility; during the overlap of U.S. afternoon and Asia early morning, there can be lulls or sometimes the opposite (if a big move happens when one region is offline, it might accelerate due to thinner liquidity). For dollar bars specifically, high activity hours will simply result in **more bars** being generated (since the \$ volume threshold is reached faster). Thus, we may implicitly see **denser bar timestamps during peak hours** and sparse bars overnight. Empirically, one might find that a disproportionate number of dollar bars fall in (say) 13:00–17:00 UTC vs 03:00–07:00 UTC. **Intraday returns patterns:** Some studies have hinted at an “intraday momentum” effect in crypto – a positive return in early hours sometimes carries through the day (though this can vary). For instance, a 2022 study found evidence of **intraday return predictability (momentum in first half, reversal later in day)** in crypto markets. This suggests the hour-of-day could condition expectations: morning rallies might fade in the evening, or vice versa, perhaps due to Asia vs US trader behavior. **Intra-day seasonal effects:** No single hour always has a huge edge, but certain hours show consistently higher volatility – e.g., around 16:00 UTC (coinciding with U.S. morning and Europe afternoon) often sees price moves, whereas the quietest might be around 5:00–6:00 UTC (post U.S. close, pre-Asia peak). These patterns, however, can evolve as global participation grows. **Implications:** For BTC/USDT feature engineering, hour\_of\_day can help models capture periodic liquidity cycles – e.g., anticipating that a breakout attempt at 2 AM UTC might fail due to low participation, whereas one at 14:00 UTC might have more follow-through. But caution: crypto can defy typical patterns on news events (which can drop at any time). Still, statistically, **time-of-day effects are present** (though weaker than in equities, since crypto never sleeps).

* **Day of Week Patterns:** Cryptocurrencies trade through weekends, which introduces interesting weekly effects absent in traditional markets. **Volume and Volatility by Day:** Research shows **weekends (Saturday, Sunday) tend to have lower trading volume on average**, as institutional participants are fewer and some traders take breaks. Lower volume can lead to **higher volatility in price** for a given volume (since order books may be thinner). It’s often observed that weekend price moves can be outsized relative to the volume – possibly due to fewer market makers on duty. Conversely, **Mondays often show higher volume and volatility**, possibly as markets “catch up” with weekend news or as institutional desks come online. In fact, one academic study found that **Bitcoin’s returns on Mondays were significantly higher than other days of the week** – a stark contrast to the stock market where Monday is often weak. This “Monday effect” in Bitcoin could be linked to weekend price buildup being realized on Monday. Another study noted **Monday and Thursday had significantly high volatility** for Bitcoin. Some explanations include: Monday’s volatility/returns spike from weekend mean-reversion or news digestion, and Thursday perhaps due to some weekly cycles (e.g., options expiry or mid-week trend shifts). **Bull vs Bear Weekly Patterns:** These effects can shift with regimes. In bull markets, weekends have sometimes seen *huge* rallies (as retail trading flows in when free from work, and thin liquidity exaggerates moves). For example, during the 2017 bull run, it was not unusual for Bitcoin to surge over a weekend when traditional markets were closed. In bear markets, weekends often saw drift downward or very quiet trading, with big moves happening on weekdays when larger volumes returned. **Known patterns:** A notable phenomenon is the Sunday night/Monday morning effect around the CME futures open (Sunday 23:00 UTC): often Bitcoin experiences a price “gap” around that time as futures traders react to weekend spot moves, leading to volatility. Additionally, some analyses (e.g., by trading firms) report **lower average returns on weekends and higher on certain weekdays**, but these are not consistent year-to-year. One source indicated **BTC had a unique pattern of positive Monday returns** which presented a tradable anomaly for a time. However, later data showed that these day-of-week return patterns are not stable – they can appear and disappear, meaning the market may have arbitraged them away. **Intra-week strategy implications:** With dollar bars, the feature s\_time\_day\_of\_week can allow a model to adjust expectations: e.g., a bar on a Saturday might behave differently (less volume, possibly more erratic price jumps) than a bar on Wednesday (higher volume, tighter spreads). Also, certain weekly flows – like **algorithmic weekly rebalances or option expiries on Fridays** – could impart patterns (for instance, increased volatility or directional bias on Fridays around 08:00 UTC when Deribit options expire, a phenomenon observed by traders). While not explicitly asked, it’s relevant that **macro factors (e.g., weekly equity market cycles)** can bleed into Bitcoin: a big move in S\&P 500 on Friday might influence BTC behavior on the weekend or Monday. In summary, **day-of-week features capture subtle but important cyclical behavior**: generally, weekdays (especially Mon-Thurs) have higher and more predictable participation, whereas weekends have outlier behavior potential (either very quiet or sometimes dramatic moves on low liquidity). Models should treat weekend data points with care, and traders often note that *weekend price moves may reverse on Monday* once volume returns, reflecting a semi-predictable weekly rhythm. However, these patterns are probabilistic, not deterministic – BTC is notorious for breaking patterns just when they become widely known.

* **Impact of Regimes on Time Patterns:** In **bull markets**, retail fervor can blur day-of-week effects – every day becomes active as new entrants trade around the clock (for instance, volumes in late 2020–early 2021 were high even on Sundays). In contrast, during **bear markets**, weekend volume can dry up extremely, and price may stagnate or slowly bleed until weekdays bring liquidity. Sideways markets might show the clearest day/hour patterns (with volume strictly higher on weekdays and during specific hours, and lulls at nights and weekends). Dollar bars somewhat normalize volume, but if on a Sunday the trading volume is low, **fewer bars will form** – meaning our dataset inherently has a time distortion: *clusters of bars during busy times and gaps during quiet times*. Therefore, careful analysis might reveal that features like hour\_of\_day are correlated with bar density; e.g., if a certain hour rarely has bars, it implies that hour typically has low trading activity (which could correlate with price behavior). **Academic consensus:** Time-based anomalies in Bitcoin exist but are not as pronounced or consistent as in equity markets. They are also diminishing as the market matures and arbitrageurs capitalize on them. Still, **known tendencies** (like stronger Mondays and more erratic weekends) remain a consideration. By indicating analogies from other assets: in FX markets (also 24/7 weekdays), volatility is higher during London/New York hours and lower during Asia late session – Bitcoin’s pattern is similar but with the weekend effect added. Unlike equities, Bitcoin has no “overnight gap” in trading, yet the concept of “overnight risk” translates to the period when major exchanges or institutions are offline (often weekends).

In conclusion, **BTC/USDT engineered features show distinctive behaviors and distributions**. **Log returns** are non-normal with heavy tails and regime-dependent skewness; they require understanding volatility regimes. **Volume features** highlight how many BTC trade per dollar – revealing shifting liquidity and activity (extreme values flag market-moving events). **Technical indicators** like RSI, ATR, ADX must be contextualized for crypto’s high volatility and trending nature – e.g., RSI extremes are common and trends can mute its signals, ATR captures Bitcoin’s famous volatility cycles, and ADX effectively identifies trend strength across bull/bear phases. **Order flow and microstructure features** (trade imbalance, intra-bar volatility) provide a granular look at market sentiment and stability – extreme imbalance often precedes price movement, and surging intra-bar volatility signals turmoil or transitions. **Time-based features** encode the 24/7 market’s rhythm – with notable hour-of-day and day-of-week patterns tied to global trading cycles. All these features can shift behavior across **market regimes**: bull markets may push indicators to their extremes (e.g. high RSI, high ADX, positive imbalance) for prolonged periods, whereas bear markets test the opposite extremes (low RSI, high ATR during crashes, negative imbalance). Sideways markets often see these features revert to mid-range or low-activity states. By combining insights from academic research and crypto-specific observations, we can better interpret these features: for instance, recognizing that a high ATR and high trade imbalance during a bull run likely means a **continuation break** upwards, whereas the same in a late-stage bull might warn of **volatility and a possible reversal**. In summary, successful analysis or modeling of BTC/USDT needs to account for these nuanced characteristics – heavy-tailed returns, volume-volatility coupling, indicator ranges that differ from traditional assets, microstructure signals of sentiment, and temporal patterns – all of which together paint a comprehensive picture of the market’s state.
