# Critical Review of Project Minotaur EDA Findings

## Critique of Existing Interpretations

**Feature Distributions:** The EDA provided detailed descriptions of each feature’s distribution, correctly noting characteristics like skew and kurtosis. For example, short/medium/long log returns were found to be **centered around zero with extreme fat tails and slight positive skew**, which is expected in financial returns (large jumps occur but are infrequent). This interpretation is accurate; however, it remains somewhat surface-level. The EDA might have missed deeper insights such as whether **extreme return outliers correspond to particular market events or regime changes**. For volume-related features, the analysis highlighted **massive right-skew and multi-modal behavior** (e.g. `dollar_volume` clustering near the 2M volume-bar target but with occasional huge spikes, and BTC `volume` showing multiple modes). This correctly suggests different volume regimes (perhaps corresponding to varying price levels or times of day). A potential oversight is not investigating **what causes the multi-modal volume distribution** – for instance, whether the modes align with specific periods (such as distinct phases of market price or day vs. night trading activity). The **RSI (14) distribution** was appropriately noted as roughly bell-shaped around 50 (as designed), but the EDA stops at confirming it uses the full 0–100 range. It could further consider how often RSI reaches extreme thresholds (e.g. >70 or <30) and if those extreme regions have any relationship with the target. Similarly, for **ATR (14)** and **ADX (14)** the EDA correctly observed positive skew with a heavy right tail, indicating occasional high-volatility or strong-trend regimes. A more nuanced interpretation could explore whether **bi-modal or shoulder patterns** in ATR (noted as a possible secondary peak) correspond to identifiable market conditions (e.g. calm vs. turbulent periods). The **trade imbalance** feature was described as mean-zero and highly peaked with frequent saturations at -1 or +1. This suggests many bars have balanced buy/sell pressure, but some are dominated by one side. The interpretation is logical, though somewhat simplistic – the EDA doesn’t discuss whether **extreme imbalance bars (where the feature hits ±1)** lead to significantly different outcomes or follow certain patterns (they might coincide with breakout moves or liquidity-driven events). The intra-bar tick metrics (price volatility, skewness, kurtosis) were rightly characterized as **mostly near-zero with occasional large spikes**. This points to most 2M-volume bars having minimal intra-bar movement, with a minority exhibiting dramatic tick-to-tick variation. The reasoning is sound, but the EDA could be overlooking that those “outlier” bars might carry **disproportionate importance** – for instance, a bar with extremely high tick volatility or skewness could signal the market is in turmoil or transition, possibly affecting the likelihood of hitting stop loss or take profit. In summary, the distribution interpretations are generally on-point, but they sometimes stop at description without connecting back to potential impact on the target or strategy (e.g. *“We see fat tails”* vs. *“Fat tails mean occasional large moves that could trigger stop or target events”*).

**Inter-Feature Correlations:** The analysis correctly identified **strong multicollinearity** among many features, especially within feature families. It noted that OHLC price features and their derived indicators (like moving averages), as well as the same type of indicator across different resolutions (e.g. short vs. long RSI), are highly correlated. This is expected: many Minotaur features are inherently related (for example, a long-resolution moving average will trend similarly to a medium-resolution MA, and successive bar prices are naturally correlated). One minor shortcoming is that the EDA didn’t quantify these correlations or highlight specific pairs beyond general families. For instance, it’s likely that **`volume` and `dollar_volume` are almost duplicates** (since dollar\_volume = volume \* price, they convey similar information, just scaled by price), or that **short-term and long-term returns have significant overlap** if the long-term return aggregates several short-term moves. The EDA flags the issue broadly but does not detail which features might be essentially redundant. There is also no mention of techniques like clustering of correlation matrix or variance inflation factors to pinpoint the worst offenders. Additionally, while “numerous strong correlations” are noted, there’s an implicit assumption that this is uniformly problematic – an overly simplistic view, since some correlated features (especially across resolutions) could still each add value in a temporal model if they capture multi-scale structure that a model can exploit. In short, the EDA’s interpretation of feature multicollinearity is correct in warning of redundancy and inflation of feature space, but it could be more specific. It does not, for example, discuss **whether certain groups of features (like multiple highly correlated moving averages or closely related technical signals) might be pruned or combined**. This will be important to address in feature selection, as acknowledged but not yet resolved in the EDA. No outright inconsistencies were found in this section – just an opportunity to go beyond *“there are many correlations”* to identifying *which* correlations might harm modeling the most.

**Feature-Target Correlations:** The finding that **no single feature has a meaningful linear correlation with the binary target (`target_long`)** is well-noted and aligns with typical financial data behavior. The EDA reports all Pearson correlations are essentially zero (on the order of 0.01 or less), with the “strongest” being only \~+0.015 (for `trade_imbalance`) and \~-0.014 (for `tick_price_skewness`). This is a sound observation, and the EDA rightly cautions that such weak linear relationships don’t imply the features are useless – rather, it underscores the need for non-linear interactions or sequence patterns to predict the outcome. One could critique the EDA here for focusing only on linear correlation: it’s an *oversimplification* to treat correlation as the sole measure of feature relevance, since relationships could be non-monotonic or conditional. However, the EDA itself recognizes this limitation explicitly, so it hasn’t drawn any false conclusions from the low correlations – it doesn’t, for example, suggest dropping all features because of low Pearson r. An oversight in interpretation might be the lack of discussion around **rank-based correlations or other measures**; perhaps a Spearman correlation could reveal if any feature has a monotonic but non-linear relationship to the target (likely still very low, but it wasn’t explored). Also, by highlighting `trade_imbalance`, `l_rsi_14`, and `l_adx_14` as the top positive correlators (tiny as they are), the EDA hints these could be slightly helpful features. It might be slightly optimistic to even mention a 0.01 correlation – such a value is *extremely* small and could be noise. The EDA’s interpretation is careful (they note these are “very weak” and only “most notable” in a relative sense), but one must avoid **overstating** those findings. For example, saying `trade_imbalance` is the “highest” positive correlation with the target is factually true, but +0.015 is so minor that it may not be practically meaningful on its own. The EDA does maintain the proper perspective by concluding that **complex models or feature interactions will be needed**, which is consistent with the data. There is no real inconsistency here, just the caution that linear correlation was a limited lens – which the EDA acknowledged.

**Bivariate (Feature vs. Target) Analysis:** The EDA performed targeted bivariate analysis on a few features (e.g. comparing distribution of `trade_imbalance`, `l_rsi_14`, `tick_price_skewness`, `s_macd`, `m_atr_14` for instances where `target_long = 0` vs. `1`). The conclusion was that **the class-conditional distributions overlap heavily for all these features**, reinforcing that no single feature cleanly separates Stop Loss vs. Take Profit outcomes. This interpretation is well-founded: the plots or statistics indeed showed only subtle shifts at best. For example, the EDA noted `trade_imbalance` had a barely perceptible shift – Take Profit outcomes tended to have slightly higher imbalance (less negative on average) than Stop Loss outcomes. This subtle difference is correctly characterized as the most noticeable among the features examined, yet still very minor. The critique here would be that the EDA might have *stopped short* of digging deeper into such differences. **Oversight:** The analysis didn’t check if those small shifts could become more pronounced under certain conditions or thresholds. For instance, it would be insightful to know if **extreme values of a feature tilt the odds** (even if the overall distribution overlap is large). Perhaps when `trade_imbalance` is at its extremes (close to +1 or -1), the probability of a take-profit vs. stop outcome shifts more obviously – the EDA didn’t explicitly examine that. Similarly, no bivariate analysis was shown for volume or volatility features, which could have non-linear effects on the target (e.g. extremely large volume bars might coincide with specific outcomes). The selection of features for this analysis seems to have been guided by the tiny linear correlations: this is logical, but it means other potentially interesting features (like time-of-day or volume) were not checked in a class-wise manner. The interpretations made (that *“distributions are largely overlapping”* and *“no strong univariate differentiators”*) are consistent with the evidence provided. The EDA avoids any incorrect claims here – it doesn’t try to claim significance where there is none – but it **could be more comprehensive**. For example, a quick check of **target frequency by hour-of-day or day-of-week** wasn’t mentioned; if there are any time-related biases in outcomes, those were not explored. Inconsistency isn’t an issue in this section; rather, the reasoning is appropriately cautious. The main critique is that the EDA might be **too quick to conclude “no signal in single features” without acknowledging that combinations or conditional relationships (which aren’t visible in one-variable-at-a-time plots) could exist**. This is understandable at the EDA stage, but it’s worth noting as a limitation of the analysis so far.

**Outlier Analysis and Handling:** The EDA’s outlier detection (using a 3×IQR rule) highlighted several features with significant outlier frequencies. It correctly interprets many of these outliers as a product of the data’s heavy-tailed nature rather than data errors. For instance, \~1.0–1.2% of both tails for log returns were flagged as outliers – and the EDA notes these are **“genuine extreme market movements”** (a reasonable conclusion, since in finance big moves are real events). One critique is that using the IQR method on such skewed distributions can label a fairly large number of points as “outliers” (e.g. 7.5% of bars for `dollar_volume` on the high side) even though those might be expected during high volatility periods. The EDA does, however, interpret this correctly: the large percentage of high-end outliers in `dollar_volume` is attributed to **bar formation mechanics** (i.e. volume bars occasionally overshoot the 2M target when a surge of trades occurs). This is a sensible explanation. The EDA doesn’t explicitly say how they’ll treat these – presumably not removing them, since they are real events – but they wisely caution that modeling needs to account for them (e.g. via scaling or robust methods). There’s a subtle inconsistency in treating all these flagged points under the umbrella term “outliers.” For example, **`intra_bar_tick_price_volatility` had \~6.5% high-side outliers** because most values are near zero; but those “outliers” are precisely the bars where meaningful price movement happened inside the bar. Calling them outliers is technically correct by distribution, yet those might carry important information (they could indicate a bar where price whipsawed, potentially affecting stop loss/profit hitting). The EDA’s implication is to be cautious with such features – perhaps transform them – which is valid. Another slight oversight is not quantifying the combined effect of outliers on the target. We don’t know from the EDA if, say, a disproportionate number of take-profit hits occur during those outlier bars (like extremely high `tick_price_volatility` events). If, hypothetically, many stop-losses were triggered in the most volatile bars, that would be crucial information. The EDA doesn’t explore this, focusing only on univariate outlier counts. Nonetheless, the general interpretation is sound: **many features have non-Gaussian, fat-tailed distributions, so one must be careful with algorithms that assume normality or are sensitive to outliers**. The suggestion that tree-based models handle outliers better is true; however, given the plan to use a CNN-Transformer (which, like any neural network, can be sensitive to outlier scaling), the EDA perhaps underemphasized the need to explicitly **address these outliers in preprocessing** (they mention it in passing). There is no contradiction in the outlier analysis; the critique is more about emphasis: it correctly identifies issues but stops at recommending consideration, without detailing strategies (e.g. **log-transformation of skewed features**, winsorizing extreme values, or using robust scalers, all of which could be considered). To summarize, the EDA’s interpretations in this area were largely on target – recognizing that outliers are part of the data’s nature – but a bit more discussion on *how* to handle them (especially given the chosen model is not inherently outlier-robust) would strengthen the analysis.

## Additional Insights Not Captured in EDA

Despite the thoroughness of the EDA, there are meaningful patterns and potential features that were not fully explored:

* **Temporal Patterns in Target Outcomes:** The EDA analyzed time-of-day and day-of-week effects on trading activity (volume) but did not examine whether the **target outcome probability varies with time**. It would be insightful to see if, for example, **Take Profits (1) occur more (or less) frequently during high-activity periods**. Given the volume spikes around 12–16 UTC and mid-week days, one might hypothesize that higher volatility during these periods leads to more frequent hitting of either threshold (stop or profit). Perhaps *both* outcomes are more likely during active hours (because price ranges are larger), or maybe directionally the market tends to trend during certain hours resulting in slightly more take-profits. Without explicit analysis, this remains unknown. Exploring **target hit rates by hour or day** could uncover subtle cyclical effects (e.g. maybe on weekends when volatility is low, take-profits are hit less often and trades more often end up hitting stops due to drift or eventual breakout on Monday). Such a pattern was not captured in the original EDA, which focused on feature distributions but not the target distribution conditional on time.

* **Interplay of Volume and Volatility:** The EDA noted volume and volatility features separately but did not connect them. We suspect that **extreme volume bars and extreme price moves coincide**, as is common in markets (e.g. a sudden surge of volume often accompanies a breakout move). Indeed, the fact that `dollar_volume` has 7.5% high outliers and short log-returns have \~1% tail outliers suggests some of the largest volume bars are also large price movement bars. This interplay could mean that certain **regimes or events** (like news releases or liquidations) create a spike in both volume and volatility. An additional insight is that these regimes might have different behavior for hitting TP/SL. For instance, in a **volume/volatility surge event**, perhaps the direction of the move becomes more decisive (if momentum carries through) – meaning take-profits might be hit quickly if one is on the right side of the move, or stops hit if on the wrong side. The EDA didn’t explicitly check the target frequency during those high-volume high-volatility bars. A more nuanced analysis could classify bars (or sequences of bars) into “high-volatility regime” vs “normal” and see if the predictive relationships change. This was beyond the original scope but is a meaningful pattern to consider for modeling (e.g. the model might benefit from knowing when the market is in an exceptional state versus business-as-usual).

* **Conditional Feature Relationships:** The existing EDA treated feature-target relationships mostly in isolation. A missed opportunity is looking at **feature interactions or conditional effects**. For example, the slight positive effect of `trade_imbalance` on outcome might become stronger when combined with a price trend. If a bar has a strongly positive imbalance (more aggressive buying) *and* upward price movement (positive short log return), it could indicate a momentum ignition that makes hitting a take-profit more likely. Conversely, a strongly negative imbalance with a price drop could portend hitting a stop. The EDA’s univariate approach wouldn’t catch this, since neither imbalance nor return alone has much signal, but **their interaction might**. Similarly, consider **short vs. long timeframe indicators**: the dataset includes things like short and long RSI. Perhaps a scenario where **short-term momentum is positive (high short RSI) while long-term momentum is negative (low long RSI)** signifies a short-lived rally in a downtrend, which might fail (hitting a stop). The EDA didn’t explore such cross-resolution interactions – it noted that s/m/l RSI are correlated, but that doesn’t preclude using their *difference*. A derived feature like **RSI divergence** (short RSI minus long RSI) could capture shifts in momentum across scales. If not already present, this kind of feature might flag situations where short-term price action goes against the prevailing trend, potentially an important signal for mean reversion or breakouts.

* **Extreme Value Indicators:** Given the heavy-tailed nature of many features, it might be useful to create indicators for **extreme conditions** rather than using raw values alone. The EDA identified which bars are “outliers” for each feature but didn’t translate that into features. For instance, a binary feature like *“extremely high tick volatility”* (1 if `intra_bar_tick_price_volatility` is above some high threshold) could be informative. If an extremely volatile bar occurs, it might signal a chaos or transition point. Similarly, an *“oversold/overbought” indicator from RSI* (e.g. RSI > 80 or < 20) could encapsulate a condition that might have a non-linear effect on outcomes (perhaps trades initiated when RSI is extremely high or low behave differently). The current feature set has continuous RSI but not an explicit flag for extreme RSI – the model could learn it, but providing it could help, especially for a non-linear model to focus on regime changes. The EDA didn’t mention such threshold-based insights, but domain knowledge suggests they are worth considering.

* **Missing Feature: Bar Duration** – One critical piece of information in volume-bar data that the EDA did not mention is **how long each bar takes to form in real time**. Since each short bar is 2 million USD of volume, in active periods that might happen in seconds, whereas in quiet periods it could take many minutes. The *time delta* of each bar’s formation is a feature that captures market speed. A fast-forming bar (short duration) often coincides with high volatility or strong momentum (everyone trading rapidly), whereas a slow-forming bar indicates lethargic market activity. If not already included, a feature for **bar time length** could be very insightful. For example, a series of very short-duration bars (a flurry of activity) might increase the chance of hitting a take-profit (if momentum continues) or could precede a reversal after exhaustive volume. The EDA’s volume analysis hints at this (volume modes likely reflect different average bar durations at different times), but it never explicitly calls out bar duration. This is a potentially *critical behavioral signal* that appears missing from the current feature set.

* **Additional Derived Features:** The existing features cover a lot (price returns, technical indicators, intra-bar stats, etc.), but a few simple combinations could enrich the signal:

  * **Price Range vs. Volatility:** If not already present via ATR, one might consider the ratio of the bar’s high-low range to some longer-term range or volatility. This could tell us if the current bar is unusually large relative to recent history (a possible breakout).
  * **Moving Average Gap:** Given multiple moving averages (if included), a feature like the **difference between short-term and long-term moving average** (or between price and a moving average) can quantify trend strength or mean reversion potential more directly than raw MAs. For instance, if price is far above a long MA, the context might be overextended (could reverse or continue strongly – the model would have to learn which).
  * **Volume-Price Interaction:** We touched on this above, but explicitly something like **(signed) volume \* price change** in the bar could serve as a proxy for money flow or aggressive volume. E.g., if a bar’s price went up 1% and had very high dollar volume, that might be a more bullish signal than either high volume or price change alone. The dataset has trade imbalance and returns separately; a combined feature could amplify scenarios where they align.
  * **Lagged Target or Trend of Outcomes:** The EDA did not consider if the binary outcomes have any autocorrelation or streaks (for instance, a cluster of take-profits in a trending phase). If it turns out that outcomes exhibit some dependency (though they might not if each is an independent setup), one could engineer a feature like *“prev\_outcome”* or *“# of TPs in last N trades”*. However, caution is needed here to avoid leakage – if each row is a distinct hypothetical trade, they might not be independent in time, but including past target information might not be valid in live prediction. The EDA is silent on this, likely assuming independence, but it’s an angle to verify.

In summary, the EDA captured the broad strokes of the data well but left out **interaction effects, regime context, and certain domain-specific features**. Incorporating these additional insights – such as time-sensitive behavior of the target, multi-feature interactions, and new features like bar duration or extreme-condition flags – could enhance the feature set and ultimately the model’s ability to recognize complex patterns.

## Implications for Feature Selection & Engineering

The observations from the EDA guide us on how to refine our feature set before modeling. We can categorize features into several groups based on their distribution characteristics, predictive potential, and redundancy:

* **Promising Features for Non-Linear/Sequential Models:** These are features that showed little linear correlation on their own but are likely to be useful in a more complex model, especially one that looks at sequences of data (like our CNN-Transformer). Candidates include:

  * *Microstructural features* – **Trade Imbalance**, **intra-bar tick volatility**, **tick skewness/kurtosis**: Individually, these didn’t linearly correlate with the outcome, but they capture the *shape* of trading within each bar. A sequential model could learn patterns like *“a surge of buy imbalance coupled with rising price precedes a take-profit”* or *“extreme intra-bar volatility precedes hitting a stop”*. These high-frequency signals are not valuable to a static linear model, but in sequence (and combined with other info) they are very informative of market microdynamics.
  * *Technical indicators* – **RSI, MACD, ADX, ATR** (at various resolutions): The EDA showed these have symmetrical or skewed distributions and weak direct correlations, but they embed known market behaviors (momentum, trend strength, volatility). A non-linear model can utilize their thresholded behavior or cross-indicator interactions (e.g. if ATR is rising and ADX is high, that might signal a trending volatile market – how that affects outcome could be complex, but a deep model can learn it). Especially promising is **ADX** (trend strength) which, albeit only slightly correlated with more take-profits (+0.01), intuitively could help a model discern trending (potentially favorable for TP if trading with the trend) vs ranging conditions.
  * *Volume features* – **Volume (BTC)** and/or **Dollar Volume**: High skew aside, volume is a critical driver in financial data. A sequential model could learn that *surges* or *droughts* in volume foreshadow certain outcomes (e.g., a sudden volume spike might mark either a climax of a move or the start of one). Non-linear models can pick up volume thresholds or rate-of-change that linear correlation misses. Especially in combination with price movement, volume can signal conviction behind moves.
  * *Time-of-day / Day-of-week (categorical time features)*: These features don’t directly “cause” an outcome, but they set context (e.g., patterns might differ during New York morning vs a Sunday evening). A sequential model with these inputs can modulate its behavior based on time – effectively learning different market regimes throughout the day or week. For example, the model might learn a filter that expects **range-bound behavior at night** (making take-profit less likely unless there’s a big surprise) versus **volatile breakouts at session overlaps**. Even though time features might not correlate directly with the binary target, they are promising as *context variables* in a sophisticated model.
  * *Lagged and rolling features:* The dataset includes lagged features and rolling-window stats (e.g., previous bar’s values, moving averages or recent volatility measures). In a time-series model, some of this information might be redundant (since the model can look at past sequence directly), but they can still be useful as **explicit summaries**. For instance, a rolling  window mean or standard deviation of returns provides a quick gauge of recent trend or volatility that a convolution or transformer might otherwise have to calculate through multiple time steps. These aggregated features could help a model identify patterns like *“market has been in an extremely quiet state for a while”* or *“price has climbed steadily for the last N bars”*. They shine in non-linear models when used in conjunction with other signals (e.g., a model might combine a rolling volatility uptick with a momentum indicator crossing a threshold to decide something significant is happening).

* **Features with High Multicollinearity (Redundancy Risks):** The EDA made it clear that many features move in lockstep, which can complicate modeling (leading to overfitting or unstable feature importance). Groups of closely related features include:

  * *Price-derived features:* If the dataset contains raw OHLC prices or multiple forms of returns, these will be highly correlated. For example, **open, close, high, low of the same bar** all share the bar’s general trend; and **short vs. medium vs. long log returns** overlap (the long return might be almost an aggregation of several short returns). Including all might be redundant. We may consider using only one form (perhaps the log returns at the highest resolution as the primary price change indicator for each bar) and exclude raw prices or repetitive measures.
  * *Technical indicator families:* Indicators computed on the same underlying series tend to correlate. **RSI, Stochastic Oscillator, CCI, etc.**, if all were included, often give similar information about momentum. Our feature set specifically mentions RSI, MACD, and ADX – those are somewhat distinct (momentum oscillator vs. trend strength), which is good. But **within RSI**, we have s/m/l versions (short, medium, long). Those will correlate strongly because a large portion of price movement that drives short RSI also affects long RSI. They differ primarily in sensitivity. Using all three might burden the model with redundant inputs. A strategy could be to select one or two or to provide differences (as noted above) rather than raw values. Similarly, if multiple moving averages (MA) are present (say 50-bar MA and 200-bar MA on short resolution), they are correlated as well (they’re both tracking price, just at different speeds). Too many can inflate feature count without adding unique signal.
  * *Lagged features vs. current features:* By design, a lagged feature (e.g. previous bar’s ATR or last bar’s close price) is highly correlated with the current bar’s analogous feature (especially for smooth indicators like ATR or ADX, which change gradually). If we feed a sequence of data into a model, we might not need explicit lagged columns (the model’s memory covers that). If lagged features are included in a non-sequential modeling approach, they help, but in a CNN/Transformer that looks at a sequence of past bars, having a separate lagged feature could be redundant. We should evaluate whether to keep lagged features as separate inputs or let the sequential structure capture that information inherently.
  * *Volume vs. Dollar Volume:* As mentioned, **volume (in BTC) and dollar\_volume (USD)** are almost directly proportional (the relationship is volume ≈ dollar\_volume / price). Over the dataset, price variation will make the correlation imperfect but still very high. They represent the same concept in different units. Carrying both is likely unnecessary. We might choose one (dollar\_volume has a more stable scale centered around 2M by design; volume in BTC introduces multi-modality due to price changes). Keeping just one will reduce feature count and multicollinearity.
  * *Indicator Components:* For example, if **MACD line and MACD signal** are both features (and possibly the histogram implicitly), note that they are derived from the same moving averages. The MACD line and signal line are correlated (one is a smoothed version of the other). The EDA noted `s_macdsignal` had a small negative correlation with the target; presumably `s_macd` (the line) is similar. It might not add much value to have both – perhaps the model only needs the MACD histogram (difference) or one of the two lines, as they carry overlapping info. Similarly, if both **ATR** and, say, a *rolling volatility* measure are included, they might duplicate information about recent range. We should identify these cases and consider dropping one or combining them.
  * *Cross-resolution duplicates:* Because the data integrates short, medium, and long resolutions, some features might essentially duplicate others at different scales. For instance, a **long-resolution ATR** might correlate with a medium-term volatility measure or even with the standard deviation of recent short returns. A **long-resolution log return** over 320M volume may correlate with the cumulative sum of short returns over the equivalent period. If the model already looks at a sequence of short returns, the long return feature might not be adding new information (except for possibly extending beyond the sequence length). We should be wary of feeding highly correlated multi-scale features unless they truly provide new context the model can’t infer.

  In practice, high multicollinearity suggests we may need to **prune features or use dimensionality reduction**. This could mean removing one feature from each highly correlated pair/group (e.g. drop `dollar_volume` but keep `volume`, or vice versa; drop one of a pair of very similar technical indicators). The EDA’s correlation analysis will inform exactly which ones have r > 0.9 with each other. Another tactic is to allow the first layers of the model (e.g. the CNN filters) to implicitly combine and reduce redundant features – our CNN uses convolution across the feature dimension which can learn to compress correlated inputs. Even so, reducing obvious redundancy in the input will simplify that task for the model.

* **Outlier-Prone or Distributionally Challenging Features:** Several features have extreme skewness or kurtosis, which can pose problems for certain models and scaling methods. Based on the EDA:

  * **Log Returns (short/med/long):** Very fat-tailed (leptokurtic) distributions with \~1% of observations flagged as outliers on each end. These outliers are genuine and carry information (they represent large market moves). We must be careful: dropping them is not desirable since they likely correspond to trade outcomes of interest. However, these features will benefit from robust scaling (perhaps using a **logarithmic or hyperbolic tangent transformation on return magnitude** to compress extremes, or simply clipping extreme values to a reasonable range). Another approach is to include **indicator features for extreme returns** (as noted, maybe a boolean “large jump happened” along with the capped value).
  * **Volume features:** Extremely right-skewed. `dollar_volume` especially has a long right tail (due to occasional very high-volume bars), and `volume` (BTC) has a multi-modal right-skewed shape. These could confuse models if left raw. Likely a **log-transform on volume** would normalize the distribution considerably (turning multiplicative scale differences into additive ones). Also, for modeling, if not log-transformed, we should at least normalize them robustly (e.g. use median and IQR for scaling rather than mean and std, or apply a cap at a certain percentile). The model’s CNN with batch normalization will handle some of this, but extremely large values could still cause network activations to saturate or gradients to explode if not handled. Volume outliers (7.5% of bars) coincide with market rushes – the model should not treat them as noise to ignore, but it must not be overwhelmed by their magnitude either.
  * **Intra-bar Tick Volatility:** By definition, this is near-zero most of the time and spikes occasionally. That distribution (zero-inflated and heavy-tailed when non-zero) is tricky. A **possible transformation** is taking the log of (1 + volatility) or some power transform to reduce skew. We should also consider **treating zero as a special value** – many bars truly have essentially no volatility (flat trading), which is qualitatively different from bars that do. The model might benefit from a binary flag “any significant tick volatility yes/no” in addition to the continuous value. Without special handling, this feature’s scale (range from 0 to huge) will make normalization difficult (most values compressed into a tiny range and a few outliers far away). In any case, this feature is essential (it captures sudden microstructure turbulence), so we keep it but handle it carefully.
  * **Tick Price Kurtosis & Skewness:** These are statistical moments that can take extreme values when a bar has unusual tick distribution. The EDA noted \~2.5% high-end outliers for kurtosis. These may occasionally be astronomically high if, say, one or two ticks in a bar were outliers. Because they are less intuitive in magnitude, one might consider capping them or even using categorical bins (e.g. “extremely leptokurtic bar” vs “normal”). Their distributions being centered around 0 (for skewness) or negative (for kurtosis) with fat tails means a model could be confused by scale. We should probably scale these by a robust method (perhaps standardize after clipping at some percentile). They’re valuable though, since an extremely high tick-kurtosis bar means *most ticks were flat but one or two big jumps occurred*, which might be a precursor to hitting a stop or target.
  * **Technical Indicators with bounded ranges:** RSI is bounded \[0,100], so outliers are not an issue (it already behaves nicely; distribution was roughly normal around 50). ADX is unbounded but typically stays in a reasonable range (and EDA found essentially no outliers beyond the IQR\*3 threshold). ATR can grow large in high volatility, but even ATR14 had no extreme outliers by that method, implying its distribution has a long tail but not alarmingly so. For these features, the main challenge is skewness (ADX, ATR are skewed right). A **log or sqrt transform** could normalize ATR if needed, but it might be fine as long as we normalize (the network’s batchnorm can likely handle ATR’s mild long tail). Still, if ATR or ADX spikes extremely (say during a once-in-year volatility event), we might treat similarly to volume – scaling or clipping to avoid outsize influence.
  * **MACD and other oscillators:** EDA noted `s_macd` had \~1.2% outliers on each side, indicating a heavy-tailed but symmetric distribution (typical for an oscillator that can swing during strong trends). For symmetric outliers, one strategy is scaling by a robust measure (perhaps divide by a high percentile or use tanh scaling). Since MACD is unbounded (depends on price scale in some way), if price has trended, MACD can be large. However, we likely compute MACD on returns or normalized price differences, which keeps it in check. In any case, treating those 1% extreme values with care (not letting them unduly influence training) is needed – e.g., using a percentile cutoff or robust scaler so that a few extreme MACD values don’t dominate the gradient.

  In summary, these distributionally challenging features will likely need **feature engineering in the form of transformations** (log, cap, or scale) rather than outright removal. We do not want to discard them because they often correspond to important market events. Instead, we’ll represent them in a way that the model can ingest without numerical instability. Tree-based models could indeed swallow them raw, but our neural network will require us to tame their ranges.

* **Likely Low-Value or Redundant Features:** Based on the EDA and the above points on multicollinearity, we can identify features that probably add minimal new information:

  * **Duplicate volume measures:** We should pick either `volume` or `dollar_volume`. Since `dollar_volume` in a 2M volume-bar dataset is by definition usually \~2,000,000 (with variance when there’s overshoot), it doesn’t carry much dynamic range except for outliers. `volume` (BTC) carries the same information scaled by price, and its multi-modal nature might be less straightforward for a model. If forced to choose, *dollar\_volume might actually be less informative* (because it’s almost a constant baseline with occasional jumps). `volume` in BTC reflects how trading quantity changes with price (when price is low, you need more BTC to form \$2M, etc.), which could incidentally encode the price level trend. However, that’s a convoluted way to get price – and we already have returns to capture price movement. Thus, having both is not needed; we could drop `dollar_volume` as redundant and retain `volume` (or vice versa, but ensure one is removed).
  * **Too many correlated indicators:** If our feature list has multiple trend or momentum indicators (like say RSI, Stochastic %K, Williams %R – just as an example), many of those will be redundant. The provided list explicitly mentions RSI, MACD, ADX. If others exist (perhaps moving average crossovers or CCI, etc.), we should verify if any are effectively duplicates. For instance, **MACD and RSI** both gauge momentum but in different ways; keeping both is fine as they aren’t perfectly correlated (MACD incorporates longer-term info). But if we had **two similar oscillators** (e.g. RSI14 and RSI28, or RSI vs. stochastic RSI), one might be enough. The EDA already pointed out cross-resolution RSI redundancy, so likely we will condense there.
  * **Lagged features in sequential modeling:** As noted, explicitly including lagged features (previous bar’s values) is redundant when using a CNN/Transformer on the sequence. The model will have access to, say, the feature values at time t-1 inherently as part of the input sequence. If the data is fed as a rolling window, we might not need separate columns for lag1, lag2, etc. Those were probably more useful if one were to do a static classifier on the current row. In the deep sequential model, including them would be like giving duplicate information offset in the input vector. Thus, many *lagged features can be dropped* to reduce dimensionality, provided we feed an adequate history to the model.
  * **Constant or near-constant features:** Not mentioned in EDA (so likely none), but if any feature has little variance (for example, if a certain technical indicator rarely changes or a setting that’s fixed), that’s low-value. The time features *could* be low-value for prediction if the outcome truly has no daily pattern, but they still provide structure, so we keep them. If there was a feature like “asset name” (only one asset here) or something static, we’d drop it; but in this dataset it’s all dynamic features.
  * **Highly derived features that overlap with simpler ones:** If the dataset included something like both “price change in %” and “log return”, those are nearly the same. Or if it included an indicator that’s a linear combination of others, it might be redundant. We should review if any rolling window feature is essentially duplicating a TA indicator. For instance, ATR is a 14-bar average of true range; if there’s also a “14-bar price range” feature, that’s correlated. We would keep the more informative one (ATR gives a scaled average range).

  By identifying these likely low-value features, we can simplify the feature set. The aim is to **avoid feeding the model dozens of features that don’t genuinely expand its knowledge**, as they can increase overfitting risk and computational cost. Many of these redundancies can also be handled by the model (which could learn to ignore one of two duplicates), but removing them beforehand makes learning more efficient and interpretable.

* **Missing or Underdeveloped Feature Families:** Given the extensive set of base, technical, intra-bar, lagged, and rolling features, there aren’t glaring omissions, but a few areas could be expanded:

  * **Price Level/Structure Features:** The current features emphasize changes (returns, indicators) and volatility, but less so *absolute price level or support/resistance*. For example, we might include a feature for **position of the current price relative to a recent range** (e.g. percentile of close price in the past week’s range). This tells if the market is near a local high, low, or mid-range. Such context could influence the probability of hitting a take profit vs. stop (a trade entered near a major support might hit profit if the support holds, etc.). If rolling window features already include something like “rolling max/min”, we can derive this. If not, this is a family to consider.
  * **Event/Regime Flags:** We touched on implicit regimes (volume surges, volatility spikes). We might want to create features that act as *switches* for regimes: e.g., a boolean “high volatility regime” if ATR (or realized vol) is above a quantile, or “trending market” if ADX > 30 or if short and long moving averages are far apart. We have continuous measures (ATR, ADX) which the model can learn thresholds on, but sometimes giving a discrete hint can simplify learning of qualitatively different states. The EDA identified regimes in distribution (like bimodal volume or ATR’s two peaks) but did not turn that into features. This could be an area of feature engineering to explore.
  * **Interactions and Ratios:** As discussed earlier, some interaction features could be explicitly added (though a non-linear model can create interactions, having them as inputs can help if the interaction is particularly meaningful). For instance, **short-vs-long indicator ratios** (short ATR divided by long ATR, short MA divided by long MA, etc.) to indicate how “volatile now vs usual” or how “fast the short trend vs long trend” are. If the current volatility is, say, 3x the long-term volatility, that’s a distinct state (market is unusually volatile now). The model could infer this by looking at ATR across scales, but giving it as a ratio might be more direct. The EDA didn’t explicitly propose ratio features, focusing on raw features.
  * **Order book or external data:** The EDA and our dataset don’t include this, but for completeness: sometimes adding features like order book imbalance or funding rates (for crypto) can help. These are obviously outside the provided data scope, and the instructions suggest not adding external sources without justification. Given that, we acknowledge these as possible missing pieces but not something we’d add unless we had that data available and it was deemed critical.

Bringing it all together, the EDA’s findings steer us to trim and optimize the feature set: remove redundant features that don’t add unique information, transform those with problematic distributions, and consider adding a few **strategic new features** (like bar duration or cross-scale interactions) to capture behaviors the current features might not fully reflect. This sets the stage for a cleaner input to the CNN-Transformer model and more focused feature selection in the next phase.

## Guidance for Model Architecture (CNN-Transformer) in Light of EDA

The planned model is a hybrid CNN-Transformer, which seems well-suited to the data’s characteristics, but the EDA insights suggest a few points of emphasis and possible adjustments:

* **Suitability of CNN-Transformer:** Given the data is sequential (time-ordered bars) with no strong single-point predictors, a sequence model is indeed appropriate. The CNN component excels at capturing **local temporal patterns** and doing some initial feature combination, which can address the short-term dependencies (like sequences of a few bars that form a pattern – e.g. a rapid 3-bar price increase with high volume). The Transformer component can capture **longer-range relationships and context**, integrating information across many bars (such as multi-hour trends or multi-day cycles) and between multiple features. The EDA showed that linear separability is essentially non-existent and that subtle interactions over time will be key – exactly the scenario where a CNN+Transformer (a non-linear sequential model) should shine. In particular, the heavy-tailed distributions and near-zero linear correlations imply that the model will need to learn **thresholds and conditional rules** (e.g. “if feature A is extremely high and feature B is in a certain range, then probability increases”) – deep networks are capable of this. Also, the data’s time structure (volume bars coming at irregular real-time intervals) can be handled by sequence models as long as we feed in time indicators (hour/day) or positional encodings, which we have. So fundamentally, the CNN-Transformer architecture is a **sound choice** for capturing what the EDA indicates: non-linear, context-dependent patterns in a noisy financial series.

* **Data Preprocessing for the Model:** One critical guidance from the EDA is the need for **robust feature scaling/normalization** before or within the model. The CNN and Transformer layers themselves don’t inherently address skewness or outliers – in fact, very skewed inputs could harm training (for example, an extremely large volume value could saturate activations). We should ensure to apply appropriate transformations (as discussed in feature engineering) or use layers like **Batch Normalization** (which, fortunately, the model does include after CNN layers) and possibly **Layer Normalization** in the Transformer, to mitigate the effects of heavy-tailed inputs. The architecture already uses batch norm in the CNN blocks, which will help keep activations from blowing up due to outlier values. However, batch norm can itself be influenced by outliers in a batch – thus, providing input features on a roughly normalized scale (e.g. log-transformed volumes, standardized returns) will still be important for stable training.

* **CNN Receptive Field & Dilation:** From the EDA, we glean that some patterns of interest might span a relatively long sequence of bars. For instance, the **long resolution is 320M volume**, which likely covers a significant time span (potentially many hours or days of trading, depending on activity). Our sequential model should be able to capture effects that span at least that many short bars, if not more. The CNN stack in the model uses *causal convolutions and possibly dilation* (as we saw, it is configured with filters and dilation rates). This is encouraging because dilation can exponentially increase the receptive field of CNN layers without a huge increase in parameters. We should configure the CNN such that its effective receptive field (especially when combined with any pooling/strided convolution) covers the length of patterns we care about. For example, if we suspect that **the last 50–100 short bars (covering one medium bar or more) influence the outcome**, the CNN’s kernel sizes, dilation, and stacking should be tuned to span roughly that many steps. If the CNN alone cannot cover it, the Transformer will handle long-range, but giving the transformer a good head start with local feature extraction over a sufficient window is helpful. In practice, if we use something like 3 CNN layers with dilation doubling each layer (1, 2, 4, etc.), the receptive field grows quickly. We just need to ensure it’s not too narrow. The EDA’s emphasis on multi-resolution means patterns might exist where a medium-term trend combined with a short-term signal is key – the CNN should be able to at least capture the medium-term trend over its layers.

* **Transformer Depth and Attention:** The transformer part will handle integrating information over the sequence and between features. One implication of the EDA is that **many features are correlated and many are noisy**, so attention mechanisms might have to effectively “decide” which features/time periods to focus on. Multi-head self-attention is advantageous here, as different heads could focus on different aspects (one head might attend strongly to volume surges, another to momentum shifts, etc.). We should be cautious with how deep the transformer is. A very deep transformer (many layers) on noisy financial data could overfit spurious patterns (especially since no strong signal stands out, the model might latch onto random coincidences if too expressive). The EDA suggests no simple patterns; the true patterns might be complex but still subtle. Therefore, a **moderate number of transformer layers** (with sufficient heads for complexity, but perhaps not dozens of layers) might strike a balance. Regularization (the model includes dropout in the transformer blocks) will be important, as indicated by EDA’s note on inherent “noise and complexity of financial markets.”

* **Mixing Multi-Resolution Features:** We should verify that the architecture properly **ingests and allows interaction of features from different resolutions**. According to the code, all features (short, medium, long) are concatenated per time step. This means at a given short-bar time index, you have features like `s_rsi_14`, `m_atr_14`, `l_adx_14` all side by side. The model, through CNN filters, will learn to combine them, but we should be mindful that some features (like `l_adx_14`) change much more slowly over the sequence than others (it’ll be nearly constant for 160 short bars if 320M volume = 160×2M bars, assuming one long bar spans 160 short bars). This could lead to redundancy in the sequence input (the same value repeating until the long bar updates). The transformer might implicitly recognize that and give less weight to repetitive info, but we might consider **enhancing how the model handles these different frequencies**. One idea is using **positional encoding** (which is already applied) – since our sequence index is along short bars, the positional encoding will treat each short bar equally spaced. Real-time gaps aren’t encoded except via hour/day features. This is probably fine, but if irregular spacing were a concern, one could use time delta as part of positional encoding or input. The provided architecture likely doesn’t do that explicitly, relying on hour/day instead. We should continue to feed those time features so the model has a notion of actual time.

* **Feature Gating and Selection in Model:** The architecture uses **Gated Linear Units (GLUs) in the CNN** – this is a form of feature gating at the convolutional layer. Essentially, each CNN layer’s output is filtered by a learned sigmoid gate, allowing the model to **select which convoluted features pass through**. This is very useful given the multicollinearity and noisy features: the GLU can learn to attenuate or amplify certain signals, acting like an automatic feature selector over time patterns. The EDA’s findings reinforce the need for such gating – because we have many overlapping features, we want the model to down-weight redundant ones. It might even learn to effectively ignore one of a pair of correlated features if it provides no extra info. Additionally, the final **Attention Pooling** layer in the transformer part will learn to focus on certain time steps in the sequence that are most relevant to the prediction. This aligns with the EDA insight that no single instant is informative without context – the model may attend to, say, a combination of the bar where an extreme imbalance occurred and another bar where a volatility breakout happened, to determine the outcome likelihood. We should encourage this by verifying the attention mechanism has enough flexibility (which it does, via multi-head attention and the custom pooling). A small caution: with so many features, the model has a high-dimensional input at each time step. We might want to include an initial **dimensionality reduction layer** (even a Dense layer) after concatenation and before the CNN, to project the input features into a more compact representation. In fact, the code snippet shows a `Dense(d_model_transformer)` applied right after concatenation (likely to project to the transformer model dimension). This can serve to condense information and mitigate some multicollinearity by learning combinations of features. It’s good to ensure that this projection (or the first CNN layer filters) has enough capacity to represent all useful combinations, but also acts as a filter for noise.

* **Handling Skewed Inputs in Architecture:** The model architecture itself can be adjusted to handle skewed distributions. For example, using **activation functions that are robust to outliers** (the model uses GELU in MLP, which is fine; CNN uses ReLU which can handle positives well but can saturate on large values only by linearity – that’s okay). We have batch normalization in CNN layers to stabilize distributions. In the Transformer, there’s likely layer normalization which is also robust. One thing to monitor is whether the **positional encoding and the magnitude of inputs** are on similar scales. Positional encodings are usually small (if standard sinusoidal encoding is used) and if our features are not scaled, the model might initially focus on feature magnitude and ignore position. After normalization, all inputs (features and positional signals) should be on comparable scale so the model can make use of both. This again underlines the need for pre-scaling features based on EDA’s stats (e.g. scale volume down by a large factor or log it, so it doesn’t overshadow other inputs).

* **Class Imbalance Implications:** The target imbalance (67% SL vs 33% TP) is not directly an architectural issue but affects training. In a CNN-Transformer, this means during training the loss will be dominated by the majority class if we don’t counteract it. The EDA mentioned possibly using class weights or resampling. We should incorporate that into the training regime (e.g. using a higher weight for the TP class in the loss function, or focusing evaluation metrics accordingly). Architecturally, one could consider using a threshold moving or custom loss (like focal loss to focus on the minority class). The model output layer is a sigmoid, which is fine for probability – but we may adjust the bias initializer (the code even suggests an output bias initializer to account for imbalance, which is good practice so the model doesn’t start at 50/50 assumption).

* **Overfitting and Regularization:** Financial data is notoriously noisy, and the EDA effectively reminds us that a lot of what the model sees will be random fluctuations. Our architecture is complex (CNN with many filters + multi-head Transformer + MLP). To prevent the model from fitting noise (finding “patterns” in random correlations), we need strong regularization. The architecture includes dropout in both CNN and Transformer layers (as per code, there’s spatial dropout after CNN layers and dropout in transformer and MLP). We might further consider **L2 weight regularization** (the code uses `kernel_regularizer` on conv and dense layers). This is consistent with EDA’s caution about many features and little clear signal – without regularization, the model could memorize quirks of the training set that don’t generalize. Another potential technique is **early stopping** based on validation performance, since the model might start to overfit after a certain number of epochs. And given many features are correlated, **reducing the model size** (fewer filters, smaller layer widths) could actually improve generalization by forcing it to focus on the strongest signals rather than memorizing everything. The architecture should be tuned (via hyperparameters, possibly using something like Optuna as hinted in code) to find an optimal size – EDA’s implication is that bigger is not always better if the data doesn’t support it.

* **Adjusting for Multi-Resolution Nature:** One possible enhancement in architecture, if needed, could be to treat different resolution features through **separate processing streams**. For example, a design could involve processing short-resolution features with a CNN of one kernel size and long-resolution features with another path, then merging. However, this adds complexity and the current approach of concatenation plus convolution is probably sufficient – the CNN can learn to differentiate by virtue of each feature’s identity. We just need to ensure the model can effectively learn the slower-changing nature of long-res features. The risk is that a transformer might attend equally to every time step’s long feature value even though it doesn’t change for many steps, possibly diluting attention. But attention mechanisms typically learn to ignore uninformative repetitions. If needed, one could add something like a **learnable feature-wise gating** (like a Vector Attention or feature selector) that at each time step weighs the contribution of each feature. That might be overkill here given GLUs and conv filters already mix features.

* **Positional Encoding and Sequence Length:** The model uses positional encoding after a projection to `d_model_transformer`. This is appropriate to give the Transformer a sense of order. One thing to note: since volume bars are not equally spaced in time, the positional encoding in terms of index might not reflect actual time intervals – but we compensate with actual hour/day features. It might be beneficial that the model is using both: positional encoding will ensure the model knows the sequence order (bar 1, bar 2, ...), while hour/day features inform *what time of day or day of week that bar index corresponds to*. Together, this addresses irregular timing. We should choose a **sequence length** for the model that covers a meaningful range discovered in EDA. For example, if patterns up to 320M (long bar) or beyond might matter, and 320M volume could span, say, a day or more, we might consider a sequence that long (if computationally feasible). Often, due to memory, one might use a shorter sequence (like 100 bars). We need to ensure key multi-resolution interactions aren’t cut off. If a full long-bar span can’t be included, at least the long-bar indicators themselves carry some info about that span. This again is a design consideration influenced by EDA: because no single timeframe was dominant in predicting outcome, including **a sufficient historical window** is likely important.

* **Model Focus and Interpretability:** After training, it might be useful to analyze what the model pays attention to (via attention weights or which convolution filters activate) to validate EDA insights. For example, does the model attend strongly to bars with high trade imbalance or volatility when predicting class=1? This would connect back to EDA findings. While not a change to architecture, this is a guidance for using the model in practice – basically to ensure it’s aligning with reasonable patterns and not some artifact.

In summary, the CNN-Transformer architecture is appropriate and, as implemented, already incorporates several mechanisms to handle the data (GLU gating, normalization layers, multi-head attention). The main guidance is to **apply rigorous preprocessing (scaling, feature selection) as discussed, and to tune the architecture’s capacity to match the data’s signal-to-noise level**. We should ensure the CNN’s receptive field and the Transformer’s sequence length cover the needed temporal context identified by EDA. We should also watch for overfitting, using the regularization techniques in place, and possibly adjust the model (e.g., number of transformer layers or convolution filters) if the EDA’s implication of weak signal manifests as the model struggling to generalize. Finally, leveraging the time features and making sure the model pays attention to them will help it handle the irregular timing inherent in volume bars.

## Overall Assessment & Recommendations

**EDA Quality and Completeness:** The exploratory analysis of Project Minotaur’s data was largely comprehensive and well-executed. It established a solid understanding of the dataset’s structure (confirming correct loading and expected NaNs), highlighted critical issues (such as the **class imbalance** of roughly 2:1 in favor of stop-losses), and gave a detailed account of feature behavior (distributions showing heavy tails, skew, and multiple regimes; pervasive **multicollinearity** across features; and the lack of any strong univariate predictor of the outcome). These findings were consistent with what one would expect in a complex financial dataset and provide a trustworthy foundation for next steps. Importantly, the EDA did not fall into the trap of over-interpreting noise – it rightly pointed out that straightforward linear correlations are minuscule and that more complex modeling is needed. Additionally, the outlier analysis showed an awareness of data quirks (like volume-bar mechanics leading to skewed volume) that will be useful when preprocessing for modeling.

There were a few areas where the EDA could have gone further. For example, examining combinations of features or conditional distributions would have added depth, and explicitly tying some of the statistical observations back to likely impacts on trading outcomes would make the analysis even more actionable. Some feature sets (like time-of-day effects on the target, or bar duration as a feature) were not explored. However, these do not significantly detract from the overall quality – they represent opportunities for extension rather than flaws. In general, the EDA did a commendable job identifying the key challenges (imbalance, heavy-tailed noise, multicollinearity) that our modeling pipeline must address. The interpretations made were reasonable and data-supported, with few if any misinterpretations.

**Key Recommendations:** Based on the EDA findings and the above review, here are several **actionable steps** to improve the feature set and modeling pipeline moving forward:

1. **Refine and Reduce the Feature Set:** Proactively address multicollinearity and redundancy before modeling. Using the EDA’s correlation matrix, **identify groups of highly correlated features and select a representative from each** (e.g. drop one of `volume` vs `dollar_volume`, choose either short or medium RSI if they overlap heavily, remove explicit lag features that a sequential model can infer). This will simplify the input space and reduce the noise the model has to wade through. In cases where correlated features each might add slight value, consider combining them (for instance, you could replace two collinear moving averages with their difference or ratio, if that yields a more interpretable signal). By pruning redundant features, we not only mitigate multicollinearity but also lessen overfitting risk and improve model training speed. As a concrete step, we might **eliminate features with correlation above, say, 0.95** with another, or use PCA on clusters of features to compress them (though a learned projection layer as in the CNN can also do this). The goal is to present the model with a leaner, more independent set of inputs.

2. **Apply Robust Feature Engineering (Scaling & Transformations):** Incorporate the EDA’s insights on distribution skewness and outliers into the preprocessing pipeline. For each skewed feature, perform an appropriate transformation – for example:

   * Use a **log or power transform for volume and ATR** to reduce right-skew,
   * Scale features like returns and MACD which have fat tails using robust scalers (center by median and scale by IQR, or clip values beyond a reasonable percentile to prevent extreme outlier influence),
   * Normalize bounded features like RSI to 0–1 range (since it’s 0–100 originally) for easier processing in the network.
   * Consider **creating binary flags for extreme events** (e.g., a feature for “extreme volatility bar” as True/False) to help the model recognize regime changes that are rare but impactful.

   These steps will ensure the CNN-Transformer isn’t hampered by raw scale differences or the occasional huge spike in a value. It will also likely improve convergence during training. Additionally, maintain awareness of the class imbalance: plan to use techniques such as **class weight adjustment or stratified sampling** during training so that the model properly learns to detect the minority class (Take Profit) patterns. The EDA highlighted the imbalance, so our pipeline should include that information – for instance, set the loss function to weigh positive examples \~2x more, or use a balanced accuracy metric for evaluation.

3. **Augment Feature Set with Interaction/Context Signals:** While being careful not to introduce data snooping, we can enhance the feature set guided by domain knowledge and EDA gaps. For example, add the **bar duration** feature (time interval per bar) to capture market pace, and possibly features that represent **relative position or divergence** (such as short vs long indicator differences, or price vs. recent range percentile). These can capture complex behaviors in a simple way. Also, ensure the time-based features are utilized effectively: if the model isn’t inherently handling cyclical nature, we might transform hour-of-day into **two features sin(hour) and cos(hour)** to respect its circular continuity (or use an embedding that learned the pattern, as long as it’s given enough data to figure out that 23 and 0 hours are adjacent). By adding a handful of well-chosen features (and simultaneously removing redundant ones as per recommendation #1), we shift the feature set to be more **informationally dense**. Each feature should contribute a unique piece of market insight – whether it’s microstructure (imbalance), momentum (RSI/MACD), trend (ADX), volatility (ATR, tick volatility), seasonal context (hour/day), or now newly added ones like bar speed or cross-scale momentum gap.

4. **Focus on Model Regularization and Architecture Tuning:** In training the CNN-Transformer, err on the side of simplicity and regularization as you iterate. The EDA makes it clear the signal-to-noise ratio is low, so it’s easy for a complex model to overfit if unrestricted. Leverage the built-in regularizers (dropout, weight decay) and consider techniques like **early stopping** on a validation set to catch overfitting early. Monitor the model’s performance on different market regimes (perhaps slice validation by month or volatility level) to ensure it’s not just memorizing a particular segment. Additionally, be open to adjusting the model’s complexity: for instance, if feature selection prunes a lot of redundant inputs, the model might not need as many CNN filters or transformer heads to achieve the same performance. A leaner model might generalize better on this data. Use the insights from EDA to guide hyperparameter tuning ranges – e.g., because no single feature is dominant, having too small a model might underfit (since it needs to capture subtle combos), but having too deep a model might pick up noise. A reasonable approach is to start with a moderate size (as per current design) and use automated tuning (Optuna or grid search) to adjust layer counts, filter sizes, etc., with an eye on validation loss. The architecture is already quite advanced (GLU, attention pooling); ensure these components indeed help by analyzing model outputs. For example, after training, examine the **attention weights from the transformer’s pooling** – do they align with bars that have high imbalance or big moves (which would validate the EDA’s suspicions about what matters)? Such interpretability steps can double-check that the model is focusing on sensible patterns.

5. **Iterative EDA-Model Feedback Loop:** Finally, treat the modeling phase as an extension of EDA in some sense. Use the model’s results to feedback into analysis – for instance, evaluate feature importance (through SHAP values or permutation importance on a tree-based surrogate) to confirm which features ended up most useful. The EDA concluded no single feature was strong; the model might discover a *combination* that is. Try to characterize those combinations (perhaps partial dependence plots in the context of sequences, or cluster the mispredicted cases to see if any feature pattern was consistently mis-modeled). This will help refine features further or adjust architecture (if, say, it turns out the model struggles with a certain regime, we might add a feature to explicitly flag that regime next round).

By following these recommendations, we aim to **improve the entire modeling pipeline’s effectiveness**. We will reduce noise and redundancy going into the model, make the training process more stable in the face of skewed data, and ensure the model architecture is tuned to capture the subtle signals that the EDA indicates are present (but only in complex form). In essence, the EDA has shown us the challenges; our task is to engineer around those challenges (via careful feature prep and model design) to tease out any predictive edge hidden in this rich but noisy dataset.
